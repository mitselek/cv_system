Requirements for the tenderer's team and CV form

General requirements for the team

1.  The tenderer must personally nominate key members of the team in the
    required roles for the public procurement to be carried out for the
    conclusion of the framework agreement. One person must be nominated
    to meet the requirements for each key role. A person nominated as a
    project manager may only be nominated for one role.

2.  The project manager of the team must be proficient in English at the
    C1 level, as their task is to check the performance of the contract,
    be a contact for the contracting authority, and prepare and check
    the procurement contract documentation mainly in English. The
    project manager must also be able to communicate with all parties
    involved in the project. If necessary, the contractual obligation is
    also to ensure the preparation of documents and communication in
    Estonian, but an interpreter may also be involved to ensure this
    condition and the condition is not related to any specific role in
    the contract.

3.  The tenderer must take into account that the contracting authority
    may need to increase the team in order to achieve the goals set in
    the public procurement. In this case, the requirements for the
    additional roles will be presented in a mini-competition. In
    mini-competitions, the contracting authority may also supplement the
    requirements for already existing roles according to the object of
    the procurement contract.

4.  „International“ is a project that has been carried out abroad,
    together with foreigners, or has an impact internationally. In the
    case of an international project that is partly related to Estonia,
    three criteria must be met in total, i.e. at the same time: 1) the
    project result is at least partly aimed at foreigners, 2) the
    project team is at least partly from abroad/abroad, and 3) the place
    where the project is carried out is at least partly abroad.

5.  The requirements set for team members are described in the CV form.

CV form

6.  The CV must show compliance with all the requirements set by the
    contracting authority, and the contracting authority checks
    compliance with the requirements on the basis of the data provided.
    The team will be deemed compliant if all the requirements and
    competencies set out in the CV form are covered by the team members.

7.  Work experience requires that it must be working for the employer in
    an employment relationship or working for the client in a project.
    If the condition does not require work experience in the project,
    reference can also be made to the acquisition of work experience in
    an employment relationship. Experience gained in the course of
    in-service training or schoolwork is not taken into account. Acting
    as a freelancer is also not counted as work experience, unless
    specific projects commissioned by a third party are referred to in
    this period.

8.  Work experience data must be submitted at least on the basis of the
    duration of calendar months to indicate the period corresponding to
    the required experience (e.g. participation in project X with a
    duration of 12.2023 – 01.2025).

9.  The "project" must be carried out for a third party, i.e. an
    external contracting entity separate from the tenderer, and the
    contracting authority does not consider works performed for the
    employer's own use or on the basis of an internal order as a
    "project" within the meaning of this document. Work done in the
    public sector can also be shown as project experience if the project
    has clearly identifiable boundaries and a contact person independent
    of the tenderer. Such work is accepted by the contracting authority
    as work experience if the condition does not require a reference to
    the project.

    1.  When submitting project data, at least the following must be
        submitted for each project: the name and brief description of
        the project, the start and end dates of the project with the
        accuracy of a calendar month, the contact details of the
        institution that commissioned the project and the contracting
        entity, and in the case of a public procurement, the public
        procurement number must be indicated.

    2.  The work experience acquired on the basis of projects that have
        been running at the same time is not summed up. The tenderer
        does not have to submit one uninterrupted project, i.e. the time
        worked can be combined between different projects.

    3.  By the time the procurement begins, the referred projects must
        have been completed in the required volume and in terms of
        competence and accepted by the contracting authority.

    4.  The contracting authority has the right to contact the
        contracting authority of the project to verify the submitted
        data.

    5.  The contracting authority shall not accept "confidential"
        projects for the fulfilment of the conditions, in respect of
        which the tenderer is unable to submit data about the project in
        accordance with the conditions and in respect of which a third
        party as the contracting entity cannot provide confirmation of
        the proper performance of the project.

    6.  Each project in the list separately does not have to contain
        copied data, it is sufficient to refer to the project
        information previously presented in the same document.

    7.  Where objectively possible, the conditions shall be deemed to
        have been supplemented by the words 'or equivalent'. The burden
        of proving equivalence lies with the tenderer who wishes to rely
        on it. Evidence of equivalence must be included in the tender.

10. The contracting authority asks for the team member's date of birth
    with the aim of identifying the person and avoiding confusion
    between the namesakes.

11. The team's CV should be submitted in the form below, filling in the
    fields provided to meet the requirement. If the tender is not
    submitted in a specific lot, the fields of that part must be removed
    or left blank.
