Equal tenders. If the tenders that have received the most value points are equal in terms of the
number of value points, the successful tender will be selected first on the basis of the points received
for the team's competence and then on the basis of the points received for the cooperation vision. If
they also overlap in lots 1-2, the successful tender will be determined by drawing lots. In the case of
part 3, we immediately move on to casting lots. The contracting authority determines the procedure,
time and place of the drawing of lots. On behalf of the tenderer, the tenderer's statutory or authorised
representative shall participate in the drawing of lots.

10.
10.1.

HOW IS THE CONTRACT CONCLUDED?

Signing of the contract. The contract shall be entered into with the successful tenderer in the quantity
specified in the relevant part. The contract is concluded on the terms and conditions specified in the
draft contract.
(Draft is in the procurement documents)

10.2.

Signing the contract. The contract will be signed digitally. The tenderer must sign the contract and
return it signed by the tenderer to the contracting authority within 5 working days. In the case of an
external tenderer, e-signing is preferable if digital signing is not possible.

10.3.

Signing a contract in any other form. If it is not possible to sign the contract digitally, the contracting
authority shall send two copies of the contract signed by the contracting authority to the tenderer
who submitted the successful tender. The contract is deemed to have been received upon receipt of
the registered letter. The tenderer who submitted a tender that has been declared successful must
return one signed copy of the contract to the contracting authority within 10 calendar days from the
9

date of receipt of the contract. If necessary, the contracting authority may extend the deadline for the
return of the contract.
10.4.

ATTENTION! If the successful tenderer fails to meet the deadline for signature and does not return the
contract signed by it within the time limit, the contracting authority has the right to consider the
tender withdrawn and to start evaluating all the remaining tenders. In addition, the contracting
authority has the right to claim damages from a tenderer who has not complied with the signing
requirement. The contracting authority shall have the same right where the successful tenderer fails
to perform the contract concluded by giving consent within the time limit set for reasons attributable
to it.
(PPA § 119)

11. HOW IS THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION ORGANISED?
IF AN ECONOMIC OPERATOR WANTS
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

IF THE CONTRACTING AUTHORITY WANTS
MORE INFORMATION:

11.1. Explanations on the content of the contract
notice and the procurement documents can
be obtained by contacting the contracting
authority in writing through the public
procurement register. The request can be
made in the communication worksheet.

11.4. The contracting authority may request
additional documents from the tenderer.
The purpose of such a request is to verify
the absence of grounds for exclusion as to
the suitability of the qualification or the
tender. The vendor submits the request via
the Register communication page.

11.2. The contracting authority shall reply to the
questions within 3 working days of the
request for clarification. The answers will be
added to the public procurement register's
communication worksheet.

11.1. Depending on the content of the question,
the deadline for replying is 3 or 5 working
days.
(PPA § 46 (4), § 104 (9), § 115 (1))

11.2. The contracting authority may extend the
time limit set for reply, either on its own
initiative or on the basis of a reasoned
application by the tenderer.

11.3. ATTENTION! It is important to submit the
request for clarification on time, i.e. at least 6
working days before the deadline for
submitting tenders. If the request for
clarification is received later, the contracting
authority is not obliged by law to respond to
the request.
