Annex 1 to the Framework Agreement - Technical Specifications
The object of the framework agreement is the purchase of the goods and services necessary for the
implementation of cyber security projects carried out by the Estonian Centre for International
Development (ESTDEV).
1. Background information
1.1. ESTDEV implements ICT and cyber security projects initiated within the framework of
international development cooperation, using the experience and know-how of the private
and public sectors. With the framework agreements to be signed, we want to involve
companies that contribute to projects coordinated by ESTDEV by developing and
implementing innovative solutions related to information and cyber security, which may
include (or partially or fully consist of) the relevant software, applications, technical
infrastructure and its components, as well as installation, configuration, training and
consulting activities related to or not related to the above.
2. General
2.1. The purpose of the public procurement is to conclude framework agreements with partners
(hereinafter jointly referred to as the contractor) for ordering cyber security-related
matters and services within the framework of Estonian development cooperation.
2.2. The procurement contract for the performance of the order submitted in the minicompetition is concluded between ESTDEV (hereinafter also the contracting entity or
contracting authority or customer) and the contractor who won the
procurement. The customer adds the project-specific content and technical requirements
of the procurement to each commissioned work separately.
2.3. The contracting authority shall apply the control of international sanctions prior to the
conclusion of contracts with contractors. The contracting authority shall not enter into a
public contract and shall exclude from the procurement procedure a tenderer or applicant
with whom the conclusion of the public contract would violate an international sanction or a
sanction imposed by the Government of the Republic within the meaning of the International
Sanctions Act.
2.4. The beneficiaries of the works and services performed within the framework agreement are
often people and institutions located in foreign countries. Therefore, it is necessary to
consider the specifics of the destination country in each case. The contractor is responsible
for complying with the norms of the destination country (electricity, occupational safety,
communications, etc.) and is responsible for the work of its subcontractors and on-site staff.
Employees sent to work in the destination country must meet the requirements described in
the basic document of this public procurement "PEE Annex 1 – Requirements for the
tenderer's team and CV form". The contracting entity has the right to demand the
involvement of partners located in the countries of destination in mini-competitions, the
respective conditions will be presented in the mini-competition.
2.5. All equipment and configurations supplied by the contractor must comply with EU data
protection and information security standards.

2.6. The contractor must ensure that the installation, maintenance and warranty services of the
equipment supplied under the framework agreement are available in the country of
installation. The contractor ensures that it has sufficient technical capacity, resources and, if
necessary, local partners to carry out the work in the destination country. All local laws,
standards and requirements (including occupational safety, electrical and communication
regulations) must be complied with at the contractor's expense and responsibility.
