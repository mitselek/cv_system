PEE Annex 2 – Market Survey Summary
The contracting authority conducted a market survey involving the partners of ITL (Estonian Association of Information Technology
and Telecommunications), TMPO (Tallinn Mechanism Project Office) and SIDA-ESTDEV project CURE™ (Cybersecurity for Ukraine:
Resilience and Enhancement) in Ukraine.
As a result of the market research, a number of questions were asked and proposals were made, an overview of which is presented
below:

operations in several countries, please confirm: 1 Whether
the turnover requirement may be aggregated across the
bidder’s group entities, branches, or subsidiaries operating

purpose of the division.

The documents currently refer to English and Estonian as
the working languages, while Ukrainian is not mentioned.
Considering that most of the framework’s activities will be
implemented in Ukraine and that direct interaction with
Ukrainian institutions and experts will be required, we
would recommend including Ukrainian language
proficiency as a relevant requirement for project teams
operating in Ukraine. This would ensure smoother
coordination and communication with local recipients and
stakeholders.
The project manager of the team must be fluent in Estonian.
Question: What is ESTDEV's vision of the project team
and how it works? The requirements state that the Team's
project manager must be proficient in Estonian, and at the
same time, the procurement is open to non-EU countries in
addition to the EU. Are these companies from non-EU
countries really expected to participate in the procurement
and are these companies expected to hire Estonians as
project managers for the team??

The contracting authority analysed the Yes
proposal and found that, taking into account
the content of the projected projects, it is
appropriate to require the project manager to
speak English, which ensures smooth
cooperation between the parties. However, the
tenderer must take into account that the
procurements will be carried out in accordance
with the Language Act at least in Estonian, and
if possible also in English. The contract partner
must also be able to ensure communication in
Estonian and prepare documents, if necessary,
but an interpreter can also be used for this.
The contracting authority allows the Yes
submission of tenders in English (the relevant
right specified in the Procurement Registre in
the subsection "Additional details of the
procurement").

tender into English in the case of work carried out in a
foreign country).
As most Ukrainian recipient institutions are objects of
critical infrastructure, we strongly recommend that all
installation, configuration and training activities be carried
out by personnel fluent in the Ukrainian language. This will
guarantee precision, operational safety and effective
communication during all stages of implementation.
In point 1.1, it is incomprehensible why the project
manager may not also perform another role in the project,
if necessary. Also, a situation may arise if a consultation
(consultant) and a penetration tester are needed in the
project and they are listed as key roles, then two different
people should definitely be involved, while a cybersecurity
specialist is generally able to both successfully consult and
perform a pentest.

If necessary, the condition is established in a No
mini-competition
and
the
respective
possibility is regulated by the framework
agreement.

The contracting authority wishes that the key No
roles presented in the procurement for
concluding the framework agreement would
be mutually supportive. The contracting
authority wants to make sure that the partner
has a competent team. Considering that key
members in 2-3 roles have been asked, the
contracting authority does not consider the
requirement to be unreasonably restrictive. It
is possible to take a more flexible approach to
assembling specific teams within the
framework of mini-competitions.

will give additional points or preference for already having
identified local partners.
The requirements for the tenderer's team in point 3 PART 1
(people/roles) are very strict. At least 5 years of work
experience (in the role of project manager, consultant) and
participation in at least 10 projects during this time is
required, which is a very large number. This means that, in
essence, the project should only be carried out with senior
roles. Our proposal is to ask for a tender in the
procurement, where roles of different levels - expert, senior,
junior - can participate. The roles have different work and
project experiences as well as hourly rates. At the same
time, the above-mentioned requirement only favours those
carrying out very short-term projects. Information and
cyber security projects are long-term, many e.g. 3-year
projects, so the requirement is disproportionate in the
current wording. Proposal: For example, it would be
reasonable to participate in three international projects
over a five-year period.
Requirements for the tenderer's team set out in clause 4 for the project manager regarding the PART 2 requirement:
"Has participated as a project manager in at least ten
international consultation projects related to the field of
information and cyber security in the last five years." It is
very difficult to distinguish between projects that are purely
consulting projects and those that are not. Proposal: instead
add as a condition projects where the Project Manager has
participated in the part containing the consultation.
In terms of the requirements of the project manager and all
other members of the project team, the requirement of 10
international projects in the last 60 months is excessively
restrictive. Question: What is the purpose of such a
requirement?

In the context of finding partners for the No
framework agreement, the contracting
authority wishes to find tenderers who have an
extremely competent team of key specialists.
Of course, it is possible to involve other team
members, including those with less
experience, in mini-competitions and then in
the performance of procurement contracts, but
key members are responsible for the quality of
their work.

The contracting authority specified the Yes
requirements for the content and volume of
projects.

The contracting authority wishes to find key Yes
specialists with international experience who
have experience with different cultures and
environments. The contracting authority
specified the requirements related to
international projects and will assess the
existence of more international projects within
the framework of the evaluation criteria.

Current wording. International experience is currently
required in several separate roles (e.g. project manager,
consultant, architect, administrator), which may exclude
competent
local
specialists.
Recommendation.
International experience should be required at the company
level – showing that the company has carried out
international projects in different countries. Where
necessary on an individual basis, the requirement should
only apply to the project manager or lead expert responsible
for the overall management and quality of the project.
Experience Threshold: Leading Expert Current
Wording. "The leading expert has over 85 months (7+
years) of experience in creating and implementing
cybersecurity solutions." Recommendation. Raise the
threshold to 10 years to emphasize in-depth strategic
experience (but this should not be reflected in 2 different
projects per year). Prove through a relevant role.
Confidential projects and submission of contacts.
Current wording. "The contracting authority does not
accept confidential projects..." Recommendation. Allow
the submission of classified projects in anonymized form,
adding contacts for later verification before signing the
contract.

The contracting authority considers it No
necessary for the team members to have
personal experience in the implementation of
international projects, as the service is
provided personally. The contracting authority
has also set qualification criteria for the
company.

The contracting authority has set the Yes
minimum requirement of length of work
experience as a condition of compliance and
more than that as an evaluation criterion for
experience.
The
contracting
authority
specified the threshold somewhat in the
assessment.
The contracting authority is subject to the No
obligation to keep business secrets and keep
the tender secret pursuant to the Public
Procurement Act. In addition, the contracting
authority must carry out a check on the basis
of the data submitted regarding the conformity
of the tender, which cannot be done if the
tenderer has not submitted the required data
on the project. Therefore, the submission of
confidential projects is also prohibited, as the
contracting authority does not have the
opportunity to validate the experience in such
a case.

Number of projects vs duration Current wording.
At least 10 international projects in the last 5 years required.
Recommendation. Prioritize the duration and impact of
the experience; ask for 3 major projects in the last 5 years
(or split into phases by program). The number of projects is
not a sign of quality/competence. An alternative proposal is
to reformulate the requirement as the volume (in hours)
that has been carried out as a project manager in
international information and cyber security projects over
the past five years. NB! The proposal applies to all roles and
parts of the project.
Expansion of the project manager's experience
Current wording. 60 months of experience in the field of
information and cybersecurity. Recommendation.
Experience in software development and digital consulting
project management should also be taken into account, if
the content of the work is relevant.
5. Part 3 – Project Manager Current wording. "60
months of experience in analysis and prototyping."
Recommendation. Add "or at deployment" to cover
the entire lifecycle.
6.
Architect
(part
3)

wording.
"Participated in at least ten international ICT
infrastructure implementation projects in the last
5 years." Recommendation. Add "analysis and/or
design" as equivalent experience.

It is essential that all equipment delivered to Ukrainian
institutions under the Framework Procurement comes with
an official manufacturer’s warranty that is valid and
enforceable on the territory of Ukraine. The supplier
should ensure the availability of an authorised service
centre in Ukraine capable of performing warranty
repairs or replacements within one business day, in
accordance with the warranty terms. The warranty
documentation should explicitly indicate that Ukrainian
recipients are recognised as warranty beneficiaries and
confirm that service and spare parts are available locally.
Please note that, in the absence of such provisions,
Ukrainian recipients may not be able to formally accept or
register the delivered equipment.
Section 5.2.4 states that 'the contractor is obliged to
provide a warranty of at least 24 months for the
goods to be supplied...' Proposal: This wording could be
specified in the procurement: for example, "delivered
products" instead of "deliverables" or exclude
consultations, penetration testing, etc. The provider cannot
provide a guarantee for the services (pentest, code review,
etc.).
3.3.2. Training on the implementation of various standards
and frameworks (NIST, ISO, CIS, GDPR, NIS2, etc.);
Proposal: I would like to add here as examples the
frameworks concerning the cybersecurity of equipment: EU

In our opinion, the ISO 27001 requirement established in
Part 1 of the procurement is disproportionate and it is not
directly necessary to achieve the objective of PART 1.
However, the provision of such a requirement would inhibit
the effective exploitation of potential competition:o The
provision of information and cyber security consulting
services in international development cooperation projects
does not require the existence of this standard, because the
providers of such services are generally not (and should not
be) companies that need to protect a large amount of
sensitive information. The ISO 27001 standard and
equivalent systems are primarily used in companies with
critical information and infrastructure, where it is
necessary to strictly handle and protect a large amount of
very different sensitive information (including IT
companies, financial institutions, healthcare institutions,
etc.). Proceeding from the general principles of public
procurements (§ 3(1) and (3) of the PPrA), the procurement
conditions must be proportionate, i.e. related to the object
of the procurement and should not restrict the effective
exploitation of competition in the market. If the
procurement condition is not necessary for the achievement
of the objective of the procurement and creates unjustified
restrictions on participation, such a requirement is in
conflict with the Public Procurement Act and should be
omitted from the procurement conditions.

requirement for project manager and consultant certificates
is unjustified, the existence of the required certificates is not
an unavoidable prerequisite for fulfilling the role of project
manager and consultant, and such a condition would
potentially limit the range of tenderers participating in the
procurement. As the existence of the certificate is not

necessary for achieving the objective of the procurement,
the requirement can be considered disproportionate within
the meaning of the Public Procurement Act.
The weight of the cooperation vision is significantly lower
(20%) in all parts of the evaluation criteria compared to the
team and price parts. Only on the basis of a vision drawn
up for evaluation can it be possible to assess the actual
capabilities and experience of the tenderer and to rule out
unstable projects filled with random people. Proposal: to
increase the weight of the vision of cooperation, i.e. for
example, 30% price + 30% competence + 40% vision of
cooperation. Also, the evaluation of the criterion "vision of
cooperation" is too general (for example: The tenderer's
vision of cooperation meets the needs of the contracting
authority). Specific criteria could be included.
We also consider the requirement of 10 and 15 international
projects to be too strict for receiving points. Again, only
senior consultants and experts are suitable for these
conditions.
