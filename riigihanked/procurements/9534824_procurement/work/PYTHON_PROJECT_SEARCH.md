# Python Project Investigation Results

**Date:** 2025-11-27  
**Status:** ⚠️ NO QUALIFYING PROJECTS FOUND

---

## Projects Investigated

### 1. Entu Platform (Entusiastid OÜ, 2010-present) ❌ DISQUALIFIED

**Technology Stack (VERIFIED):**

- Backend: JavaScript (Node.js), NOT Python
- Frontend: Vue.js (JavaScript)
- Database: MongoDB, NOT PostgreSQL
- Source: <https://github.com/entu/api> - "JavaScript 100%"

**Qualification status:** DISQUALIFIED (not Python-based)

---

### 2. PÖFF Platform (Ilusa Koodi Instituut, 2021-2024) ❌ DISQUALIFIED

**Role:** Development Lead (Arendusjuht)  
**Duration:** 2021-08 to 2024-10 (3+ years)  
**Team:** Led 4-member development team  
**Scope:** Festival website and logistics system

**Technology Stack (VERIFIED):**

- **Backend:** JavaScript (Node.js) - Strapi CMS
- **Frontend:** JavaScript - Pug templating, Static Site Generator (SSG)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (confirmed in config/database.js)
- **Languages:** JavaScript 42.4%, Pug 36.3%, Stylus 19.4%, Shell 1.8%
- **Deployment:** Shell scripts, database backups
- **Source:** <https://github.com/poff-bnff/web2021>
- **Your contribution:** Yes, visible as @mitselek in contributors (13 contributors total)

**Qualification status:** ❌ DISQUALIFIED (not Python-based)

**Note:** While database is PostgreSQL (would be 2 points), the backend is Node.js/Strapi (JavaScript), not Python. Does not meet primary "Python IT services" requirement.

---

### 3. Tartu University (2014-2015) ⬜ INSUFFICIENT HOURS

**Role:** Software Developer (Teadustarkvara arendaja)  
**Duration:** 2014-09 to 2015-12 (1 year 3 months = ~15 months)  
**Work:** Language resource archiving tools, Entu deployment

**Technology Stack:** Python, JavaScript documented

**Hours estimate:**

- 15 months employment
- ~150 hours/month = ~2250 hours TOTAL
- BUT: Mixed Python + JavaScript + Entu (Node.js) deployment
- Pure Python hours: Likely 500-1000 hours (BELOW 2000 threshold)

**Qualification status:** ⚠️ INSUFFICIENT - Does not meet 2000+ Python hours for single project

---

### 4. Justice Ministry (2002-2005) ❌ NOT PYTHON

**Role:** Analyst/Developer  
**Duration:** 2002-08 to 2005-08 (3 years)  
**Technology:** Oracle, Java (documented in other assessments)

**Qualification status:** DISQUALIFIED (not Python)

---

### 5. Eesti Mälu Instituut (2017-2024) ⬜ TECHNOLOGY UNKNOWN

**Role:** Various IT projects  
**Duration:** 2017-2024 (7 years part-time/consultant)

**Technology Stack:** NOT DOCUMENTED

**ACTION REQUIRED:**

- [ ] Review work at Eesti Mälu Instituut
- [ ] Any Python-based projects with 2000+ hours?
- [ ] If YES: Document, get client confirmation

**Status:** ⬜ TO INVESTIGATE (lower priority than PÖFF)

---

### 6. KBFI (1986-1990) ❌ TOO OLD

**Role:** Programmer  
**Duration:** 1986-1990  
**Technology:** Python mentioned in skills_demonstrated

**Qualification status:** DISQUALIFIED (too old for "last 48 months" requirement, also timeline inconsistent - Python released in 1991)

---

## Summary

### Qualifying Python Projects with 2000+ Hours

**Count:** 0 (ZERO) verified

**Investigated and DISQUALIFIED:**

1. **Entu Platform:** JavaScript/Node.js + MongoDB (NOT Python + PostgreSQL)
2. **PÖFF Platform:** JavaScript/Node.js/Strapi + PostgreSQL (NOT Python)
3. **Justice Ministry:** Oracle/Java (NOT Python)
4. **KBFI:** Too old, timeline inconsistent

**Insufficient hours:**

- **Tartu University:** Python used but likely <2000 hours in single project

**Candidates to investigate (low probability):**

1. **Eesti Mälu Instituut:** ⬜ Possible but undocumented, lower priority

---

## Python Skills Evidence

**Proficiency level:** 9/10 documented ✓

**Where Python was used:**

- Tartu University: "python" in skills_demonstrated
- Entusiastid OÜ: "python" in skills_demonstrated (but Entu is Node.js)
- Various CVs: Python 9/10 listed consistently

**Possible explanations:**

1. **Scripting and automation:** Python used for smaller tasks, not 2000+ hour projects
2. **Mixed projects:** Python used alongside JavaScript in projects
3. **Internal tools:** Python tools not documented as separate projects
4. **Learning and practice:** Skill development without large client projects

**CONCLUSION:** Python skills are REAL, but large Python projects are NOT DOCUMENTED

## Implications for Procurement 9534824

### Current Portfolio Score: 0 points out of 60 (CONFIRMED)

**Reality:** Both Entu AND PÖFF are JavaScript/Node.js, NOT Python

- **No Python reference projects to submit**
- **Portfolio points:** 0 out of 60
- **Cannot compete** against contractors with 45-60 portfolio points
- **Must pursue 100% partnership route** - partner provides ALL 3 reference projects (54-60 points)

**Your contribution without portfolio:**

- Project Manager skills (15+ years, government systems, native Estonian) ✓
- Python development expertise (9/10 proficiency documented) ✓
- System architecture ✓
- Estonian language advantage ✓
- BUT: No Python project portfolio to demonstrate

**Partnership dependency:**

- Partner MUST provide all 3 reference projects
- You depend entirely on partner's portfolio score
- Lower negotiating leverage (no portfolio to contribute)
- Revenue split likely 25-35% vs 40-60% if you had projects

## Urgent Actions (Day 1)

### Priority 1: PÖFF Verification

- [ ] **Contact:** Ilusa Koodi Instituut / PÖFF
- [ ] **Question:** What was the technology stack for the festival platform?
  - Was the backend Python, JavaScript (Node.js), PHP, or other?
  - What database was used (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)?
  - Were there Docker containers, Kubernetes?
  - What was the deployment method?
- [ ] **If Python:** Request to document as reference project
- [ ] **Hours:** How many contractor hours did you contribute? (Need 2000+)

**Contact info:** Check employment records, LinkedIn, or festival contacts

### Priority 2: Partnership Outreach (if PÖFF not Python)

**Estonian Python Development Companies to Research:**

- Nortal (likely too big for partnership)
- Trinidad Wiseman
- Playtech Estonia
- Proekspert
- Helmes
- Mobi Lab
- Smaller Python specialist shops

**Partnership proposition:**

- Your strengths: Python 9/10, PM 15+ years, government systems, native Estonian
- Their strengths: Python project portfolio (Docker/K8s/X-Road), existing team
- Revenue sharing: Negotiate based on contribution (60/40 or 70/30)

## Decision Matrix

| Scenario                         | Portfolio Points    | Winning Probability | Action                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| PÖFF is Python + strong partner  | 44-52               | 70-80%              | ✓ PARTICIPATE              |
| PÖFF NOT Python + strong partner | 54-60 (all partner) | 65-75%              | ⚠️ CONSIDER (lower margin) |
| No partner found                 | 0-12                | 10-20%              | ❌ STRATEGIC PASS          |

---

## DECISION DEADLINE: END OF DAY 1 (2025-11-27)

**Critical path:**

1. Verify PÖFF technology (2-4 hours)
2. If NOT Python: Begin partnership outreach (4-6 hours)
3. If no viable path: Consider strategic pass

**Next update:** After PÖFF verification complete
