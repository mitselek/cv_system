# Procurement 9449264 Assessment: RMK Client Portal and Timber Sales System

**Procurement ID:** 9449264

**Reference:** 301632

**Procurer:** Riigimetsa Majandamise Keskus (RMK)

**Deadline:** 2025-12-30 12:00

**Contract Duration:** 48 months (framework agreement)

**Maximum Budget:** 1,500,000 EUR (excl. VAT)

**Evaluation:** 20% Development hourly rate + 5% Maintenance hourly rate + 65% Solution and innovation + 10% Risk management

---

## Executive Summary

**Participation Feasibility:** CHALLENGING

**Winning Probability:** 35-40% (CONDITIONAL)

**Key Constraint:** Team assembly required - 7 specialists with specific qualifications

**Strategic Assessment:** This is a high-value, long-term framework agreement for developing RMK's client portal and timber auction system. You have strong matches for 3-4 roles (Project Manager, Senior Developer/Architect, potentially Analyst and Developer), but critical gaps exist: no Scrum certification, limited UI/UX design portfolio, no ISO 27001 certification, and incomplete reference projects documentation. The 65-point solution quality criterion creates opportunity for innovation-driven win despite gaps.

**PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION:** CONDITIONAL PARTICIPATION - Pursue if you can assemble qualified team members for Designer, Tester, and potentially 1-2 additional developers. Your technical architecture expertise and government system experience are highly relevant.

### Decision Checkpoint (Day 5)

**After completing Days 1-5 actions, evaluate:**

**PROCEED to bid preparation IF:**

- ISO 27001 equivalent path confirmed feasible
- Financial turnover verified ≥1M EUR
- Designer partner confirmed
- Tester partner confirmed
- 1-2 Developer partners confirmed or strong leads

**PIVOT to Option 2 (Subcontractor) IF:**

- ISO 27001 path blocked BUT
- Strong team assembly + financial qualification met
- Contact: Nortal, Trinidad Wiseman, Playtech, Proekspert (ISO 27001 certified agencies)
- Offer: Senior Developer/Architect expertise for their bid

**STRATEGIC PASS IF:**

- ISO 27001 blocked AND
- Financial qualification not met OR
- Team assembly fails OR
- Opportunity cost too high vs other options

## CONCLUSION

Procurement 9449264 represents a significant opportunity (1.5M EUR, 48 months) that partially aligns with your technical expertise but faces critical qualification barriers. Your strong matches in project management, system architecture, Java/JavaScript/Python development, and government systems experience create a foundation for participation. However, the ISO 27001 requirement presents a likely insurmountable blocker given the 33-day timeline.

**Most Realistic Path:** Partner with an established, ISO 27001-certified software agency as a subcontractor, contributing your senior developer and architecture expertise while they handle qualification barriers.

**Direct Participation Feasibility:** 35-40% CONDITIONAL - requires resolving ISO 27001 (critical), assembling 4-5 specialized team members, and verifying financial turnover. The 65-point solution quality criterion offers innovation-driven differentiation opportunity that could offset team assembly challenges.

**Strategic Assessment:** If you can secure ISO 27001 equivalent auditor confirmation within 2-3 weeks and assemble the team, this is WORTH PURSUING due to long-term framework value and strong alignment with your government systems experience. If ISO 27001 path is blocked, strategic pass is recommended, with energy directed toward better-fit procurements (database projects, Python/JavaScript development, business system integration without ISO 27001 requirements).

**Personal Note:** The requirement for GIS technologies (OpenLayers, Leaflet, WMS/WFS, PostGIS) suggests timber location mapping is core to RMK's client portal. This specialized domain knowledge gap, combined with ISO 27001 and team assembly challenges, makes this a HIGH-RISK opportunity despite your strong technical foundation. Consider whether 200+ hours investment and 20,000+ EUR upfront cost justify 35-40% winning probability, especially when subcontractor participation offers lower-risk entry to the same project.
