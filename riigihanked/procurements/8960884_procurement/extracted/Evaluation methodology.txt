EVALUATION METHODOLOGY

1.  General provisions

    1.  The Contracting Entity evaluates suitable tenders in the
        100-merit point system that is divided into weightings as
        follows:

        1.  a maximum of 50 merit points may be awarded to a tender for
            the tender value criterion;

        2.  a maximum of 50 merit points may be awarded to a tender for
            interviews.

    2.  The merit points to be assigned to a tender are received by
        summing up the merit points given on the basis of the evaluation
        methodology described in each evaluation criterion (evaluation
        criteria 1 and 2).

    3.  Tenders are ranked on the basis of the merit points assigned to
        a tender. The tender that scored the most merit points is the
        best. If two or more tenders are awarded equally the greatest
        number of merit points, the one that has been awarded more merit
        points in the interview criterion will be preferred. If these
        points are also equal, the successful tenderer will be
        identified by drawing lots.

| 1  | Value  | This criterion evaluates the value of the     | 50     |
|    | cri    | hourly price of the service as set out in the |        |
|    | terion | Tenderer’s tender, following the principle    |        |
|    |        | where the lowest is the best.                 |        |
|    |        |                                               |        |
|    |        | The tender of the lowest hourly price of the  |        |
|    |        | service out of the submitted tenders is       |        |
|    |        | awarded the maximum number of merit points    |        |
|    |        | (50 merit points).                            |        |
|    |        |                                               |        |
|    |        | The merit points of the next tenders will be  |        |
|    |        | calculated using the following formula:       |        |
|    |        |                                               |        |
|    |        | The lowest tender receives the maximum number |        |
|    |        | of points. Other tenders are calculated using |        |
|    |        | the formula: "weight" - ("tender value" -     |        |
|    |        | "lowest value") / "highest value" * "weight". |        |
