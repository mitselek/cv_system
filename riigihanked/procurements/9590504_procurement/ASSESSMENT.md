**Viability:** IMPOSSIBLE

**Blockers:**

- No PhD degree (mandatory)
- No higher education quality assessment experience
- No EU university academic governance experience
- No Ukraine/Mongolia education system knowledge
- IT/software background vs required academic/educational background

**Cannot overcome:** Education credentials cannot be acquired quickly. Quality assessment experience in higher education requires years of academic work.

### Option 2: Participate as Technical Support Partner

**Viability:** NOT APPLICABLE

This procurement is for a single expert consultant, not a team. No technical support role exists. The work is academic quality assessment, not IT system development.

---

### Option 3: Strategic Pass

**Viability:** RECOMMENDED

**Reasons:**

1. **Wrong domain entirely:** IT/software vs academic quality assessment
2. **Missing mandatory credentials:** PhD required, incomplete higher education documented
3. **No pathway to qualification:** Cannot acquire PhD and 3+ years HE quality assessment experience before deadline
4. **Domain expertise mismatch:** Your 15+ years in IT project management does not translate to higher education quality assessment
5. **Geographic expertise gap:** No Ukraine or Mongolia education system knowledge

---

## WINNING STRATEGY ANALYSIS

Cannot assess winning probability when participation is impossible due to missing mandatory qualifications.

### Likely Competitors

- Academic consultants with PhDs in education or related fields

- Quality assurance professionals from higher education agencies
- International education development consultants with Eastern European/Asian experience

---

## COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

### Not Applicable

No benefit to analyzing costs when participation is impossible.

---

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION

### PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: STRATEGIC SKIP

**Do NOT participate because:**

1. **Missing mandatory PhD credential** - Cannot fake or work around this
2. **Wrong professional domain** - IT/software vs academic/educational quality assessment
3. **No higher education quality assessment experience** - Your project management is in IT, not academia
4. **No Ukraine/Mongolia expertise** - No documented work in these regions or education systems
5. **Cannot acquire qualifications in timeframe** - PhD + years of HE quality work cannot be obtained quickly

---

### ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION: LEARN FROM THIS PROCUREMENT

**Value of this exercise:**

1. **Better procurement targeting:** Focus on procurements matching your IT/software background
2. **Understand qualification screening:** Many procurements have hard credential requirements (PhDs, certifications, licenses)
3. **Domain specificity matters:** "Project management" in IT ≠ "quality assessment" in higher education
4. **Geographic/sector expertise:** Ukraine/Mongolia education systems are niche specializations

**Better procurement targets for you:**

- IT project management consulting
- Software development procurements
- System architecture and database design projects
- Technical infrastructure projects
- IT quality assurance (not academic quality)
- Software project evaluation (not educational project evaluation)

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions

1. **Skip this procurement** - Do not invest time in impossible bid
2. **Update procurement search criteria:**
   - Focus on: IT, software, systems, databases, infrastructure
   - Exclude: Education quality, academic assessment, PhD-required roles
3. **Search for matching procurements:**
   - Python/JavaScript development
   - Database architecture
   - IT project management (software domain)
   - System integration projects

---

## CONCLUSION

This procurement is **completely outside your professional domain**. Your strengths are in IT/software project management, system architecture, and software development. This procurement requires academic credentials (PhD), higher education quality assessment expertise, and specific knowledge of Ukrainian and Mongolian education systems - none of which are documented in your knowledge base.

**Risk-adjusted recommendation:** 0% RECOMMEND PARTICIPATION - Impossible due to mandatory qualification gaps

**Strategic note:** This is an excellent example of why procurement screening is essential. You saved significant time by conducting systematic assessment before attempting to prepare a bid for an incompatible opportunity. Continue using this methodology to quickly identify and focus on procurements that match your IT/software background.

**Personal note:** Your strength is in **system architecture, IT project management, and software development**. Academic quality assessment in international higher education is a completely different career path requiring different credentials (PhD) and domain expertise (higher education governance, quality frameworks, Eastern European/Asian education systems). Focus procurement searches on technology sector opportunities where your 15+ years of IT experience is valued.
