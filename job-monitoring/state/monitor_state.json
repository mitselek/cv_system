Kansainvälinen tiimimme kehittää yhdessä useamman tiimin kanssa Guidewire Claim Centeriä, eli vakuutuksen korvausjärjestelmää. Tiimimme vastaa korvausjärjestelmän kehittämisestä. Toivomme uudelta Solution Analystiltämme ymmärrystä korvauskäsittelystä ja korvauskäsittelyn prosesseista sekä kokemusta Guidewiren ClaimCenterin vaatimusmäärittelystä. Tehtävästä Solution Analystina tulet toimimaan liiketoiminnan ja ohjelmistokehittäjien rajapinnassa, varmistaen että liiketoiminnan puolelta nousevat kehitystarpeet muuntuvat ohjelmistokehittäjille ymmärrettäviksi vaatimusmäärittelyiksi. Vastaat siis alueesi kehitystarpeiden tunnistamisesta, analysoinnista ja kuvaamisesta yhdessä sidosryhmien ja tiimisi asiantuntijoiden kanssa. Olet mukana miettimässä kehitettävän kokonaisuuden ratkaisua prosessilähtöisesti tietomallitarpeet ja ClaimCenterin toiminnallisuudet huomioiden. Näiden pohjalta luot tarvittavia kuvauksia ja dokumentoit toiminnallisia vaatimuksia. Liiketoiminnan tarpeiden lisäksi pohdit kriittisesti ja ratkaisuhakuisesti mikä on regulaation, teknisen toteutuksen ja liiketoimintaprosessien kannalta järkevin kehittämisen toteutustapa. Keräät ja havainnoit kehitystarpeita käymällä aktiivista keskustelua monien sisäisten sidosryhmien kanssa. Olennainen osa työnkuvaasi on näiden keskusteluiden fasilitoiminen esimerkiksi työpajojen muodossa. Millaista osaamista etsimme? Sinulla on vahvaa aiempaa kokemusta vaatimusmäärittelytyöstä ja olet tehnyt päätoimisesti vaatimusmäärittelyä vähintään kolmen vuoden ajan.

Kykenet siis itsenäisesti määrittämään, tuottamaan ja kuvaamaan liiketoiminnan tarpeita kehitettäviksi ominaisuuksiksi ja kokonaisuuksiksi Guidewiren standarditoiminnallisuudet huomioiden. Vaatimusmäärittelykokemuksen lisäksi etsimme osaajia seuraavanlaisella osaamispaletilla: aiempi liiketoimintakokemus vakuutuksen korvausjärjestelmien parissa työskentelystä. tekninen osaaminen ja ymmärrys, jonka avulla ymmärrät Guidewire-teknologian kehittämistä. hallitset ketteriä menetelmiä ja työkaluja. sujuvat kommunikointi- ja viestintätaidot sekä suomeksi että englanniksi. ihmisenä kestät paineiden alla työskentelyä (välillä joitain asioita vaan pitää saada tietyssä ajassa ratkottua), ja turnauskestävyyttäkin sinulta löytyy (näin suurissa uudistuksissa kun harva iso kokonaisuus ratkeaa viikossa tai kahdessa). merkittäväksi eduksi katsomme, jos sinulla on vaatimusmäärittelykokemusta Guidewiren Claim Centerin osalta. Me tarjoamme Vastuullisen työn vastapainoksi pidämme huolen työhyvinvoinnistasi ja tulevaisuuteen katsovista työjärjestelyistä. Tarjoamme sinulle vakaan ympäristön, jossa vastuullisuus, ihmisläheisyys ja yhdessä menestyminen ovat keskeisiä arvoja.

Voit työskennellä meillä kokoaikaisena tai osa-aikaisena, mikä tarkoittaa kolmea peräkkäistä kokonaista työpäivää. Päivän aloitus Päivä starttaa tiimisi kanssa myyntitoimistoltamme, jossa treenaatte myyntityön eri vaiheita esihenkilön johdolla ja asetatte päivän tavoitteet. Kohti asiakkaita Toimistolta suuntaat vaihteleville asuinalueille, yleensä esihenkilösi kyydissä. Perillä otat itsenäisesti yhteyttä asukkaisiin ja sovit tapaamisia heidän koteihinsa, usein erilliseen ajankohtaan. Tapaat päivittäin kymmeniä uusia ihmisiä, ja työ on aktiivista sekä liikkuvaa – askeleita kertyy keskimäärin yli 10 000 päivässä. Tapaamiset asiakkaiden kodeissa Istut asiakkaiden kanssa rauhassa pöydän ääressä ja käytte yhdessä läpi, miten palvelumme voi turvata heidän arkeaan. Tässä työssä kuunteleminen on yhtä tärkeää kuin puhuminen! Sinä vastaat myyntityöstä ja laitteiden asennuksesta huolehtii erillinen asennustiimi. Voit siis keskittyä täysin olennaiseen – asiakkaiden tarpeiden ymmärtämiseen ja heille sopivien ratkaisujen tarjoamiseen. Päivän päätös Illalla kokoonnutte vielä tiimin kesken: käytte läpi päivän opit, jaatte onnistumiset ja fiilistelette päivän tapahtumia. Mitä taitoja kehität myyjänä? 🧠 Tässä työssä saat olla itsenäinen ja ottaa vastuuta. Myyntityö kehittää itsevarmuutta, neuvottelutaitoja ja kykyä kohdata erilaisia ihmisiä – taitoja, joista on hyötyä elämän kaikilla osa-alueilla. Jokainen asiakaskohtaaminen on tilaisuus kehittyä – päivät ovat täynnä vaihtelua, haasteita ja onnistumisia, jotka tekevät sinusta entistä paremman myyjän. Tässä työssä oikea asenne ratkaisee: aktiivisuus, rohkeus ja halu kohdata haasteita vievät pitkälle. Sanotaan, että ovimyynti on myynnin kuninkuuslaji – jos pärjäät tässä, pärjäät missä tahansa!

      "description": "Haluaisitko laittaa persoonasi peliin tavoitteellisessa myyntityössä? Viihdytkö työporukassa, jossa on kannustava ja välitön meininki? Onko kiikarissa työ, jossa pääset itse vaikuttamaan ansaintaan? Kuulostaa ihan siltä, että voisit olla uusi työkaverimme - etsimme nimittäin Bilarille tammikuussa avattavaan Vantaan myymälään kymmentä uutta automyyjää! Mikä on Bilar99? Olemme käytettyihin autoihin erikoistunut autoliikeketju, joka haluaa tehdä asioita uudella, raikkaalla tavalla. Keskitymme pääosin ekologisiin, uudehkoihin autoihin. Vaihtoautovarastomme kattaa nykyisin yli 1 000 myytävää autoa, joista suuri osa on sähkö- ja hybridiautoja. Olemme kasvaneet nopeasti yhden liikkeen autokaupasta valtakunnalliseksi ketjuksi. Kasvu jatkuu yhä, ja mukanamme pääset kasvamaan itsekin! Yhteinen päämäärämme on ylittää asiakkaan odotukset autokaupoilla ja rakentaa kumppanuuksia, joiden myötä auto vaihtuu meillä myös tulevissa elämän käänteissä. Tavoitteenamme on tarjota autokaupan paras asiakaskokemus, ja yhtä lailla tähtäämme myös parhaaseen työntekijäkokemukseen. Arvojamme ovat rehellisyys, avoimuus ja ihmisten kunnioitus ja halu oppia ja menestyä. Niitä haluamme vaalia kaikissa asiakas-, työ- ja yhteistyösuhteissa. Millaisesta myynti työstä on kysymys? Meillä Bilar99:llä teet käytettyjen autojen myyntiä monikanavaisesti myymälässä, chatissa, sähköpostilla, WhatsApissa ja puhelimitse. Tyypilliseen työpäivään kuuluu lisäksi esimerkiksi vaihdossa tulevien autojen tarkastusta, vaihtoautojen hinnoittelua sekä yhteydenpitoa eri yhteistyökumppaneiden, kuten korjaamoiden kanssa. Ympärilläsi työskentelee avulias ja avoin työporukka myymälässä, jossa on lisäksesi muita myyjiä, myyntiavustaja sekä myyntipäällikkö, joka toimii esihenkilönäsi. Työ on monipuolista ja vastuullista, yhdessä jaamme onnistumisia ja ideoita sekä ratkomme ongelmatilanteita. Työaikasi on 37,5 tuntia viikossa ja työaika ajoittuu myymälän aukioloaikojen mukaan. Myymälämme ovat auki arkisin kello 10-18 ja lauantaisin kello 10-16. Joskus kaupan saaminen edellyttää, että olet valmis joustamaan hieman aukioloaikojen ulkopuolelle. Sinulla on työssäsi selkeät myyntitavoitteet, joiden edistymistä seuraat säännöllisesti esihenkilösi kanssa. Alussa tavoitteesi ovat luonnollisesti matalammalla ja niitä nostetaan sitä mukaa, kun kehityt myyntityössäsi. Aiempi kokemus myynnistä ei ole välttämätön, mutta aikaisempi menestyksekäs myyntityö katsotaan eduksesi. Mutta kuitenkin palvelualttiilla ja periksiantamattomalla asenteella pääsee jo pitkälle. Meillä kaupan mahdollisuuksia on tunnetusti paljon - ei kun tarttumaan niihin!

Työkaverit ovat helposti lähestyttäviä ja yhteistyö sujuu mutkattomasti. Hyväksymme myös sen, että joskus sattuu virheitä - yhdessä korjataan ja mietitään, mitä niistä opitaan. 🚀 Haluamme, että meillä jokainen työntekijä pääsee kasvamaan ammattilaisena. Tarjoamme aina työsuhteen alkuun perusteellisen myyntikoulutuksen sekä yksilöllistä koulutusta aina silloin, kun sitä tarvitset.

Roolisi meillä Etsimme tiimiimme ratkaisuarkkitehtia tai ratkaisukonsulttia , joka haluaa kehittyä monipuolisessa IT-ympäristössä turvallisuustoimialla ja olla mukana erilaisten järjestelmähankkeiden valmistelu- ja suunnitteluvaiheessa. Tässä roolissa pääset tutustumaan laajaan järjestelmäkenttään ja työskentelemään vaihtelevien tehtävien parissa – pienistä selvitystöistä aina laajoihin tavoitetilakuvauksiin asti.

Sinulta hoituvat tietojärjestelmiin liittyvät määrittely- ja suunnittelutyöt, kuten toiminnallisuuksien määrittely ja järjestelmäratkaisujen muotoilu. Keskeinen väline suunnitelmien tuottamiselle on niiden dokumentointi.

      "description": "Fellowmindilla viihtymisen taustalla on sama asia, jonka vuoksi asiakkaatkin luottavat meihin: me teemme asiat ihmisten ehdoilla. Se tarkoittaa arjessa luottamusta, vapautta ja mahdollisuutta kasvaa yrityksen mukana. Asiakastyössä se näkyy syvänä liiketoimintaymmärryksenä, henkilökohtaisena otteena sekä vahvana teknologiaosaamisena. Emme tyydy olemaan vain hyviä toteuttajia, vaan haluamme olla asiakkaillemme luotettava kumppani, auttaa heitä parantamaan liiketoiminnan tehokkuutta ja kilpailukykyä hyödyntämällä kokonaisvaltaisesti Microsoftin tarjontaa sekä vahvaa toimialaosaamistamme. Autamme asiakkaitamme digitalisoitumaan kestävästi ja rakentamaan tulevaisuutta, jossa teknologia tukee ihmisiä - ei päinvastoin. Roolisi Fellowmindilla Etsimme tiimiimme ratkaisuarkkitehtia / Agile Delivery Leadia, joka haluaa olla merkityksellisten muutosten arkkitehti. Tässä roolissa viet ideat nollasta todellisuuteen - suunnittelet, koodaat ja johdat sekä fasilitoit tiimin kohti ratkaisuja, jotka muokkaavat asiakkaidemme arkea parempaan suuntaan. Tech stackisi on moderni (React, TypeScript, .NET/C#, Azure), ympärilläsi on huippuasiantuntijoiden yhteisö ja käsissäsi on vapaus rakentaa omaa urapolkuasi. Taustaltasi olet kokenut ohjelmistokehittäjä tai -arkkitehti, joka on valmis ottamaan koppia Agile Delivery Leadin -roolista asiakkuuksissa. Tai olet ehkä jo luotsannut kehitystiimejä softakehityksen projekteissa viihtyen edelleen myös koodauksen parissa. Agile Delivery Lead koordinoi ja fasilitoi kehitystiimin toimintaa mm. varmistamalla sprinttien tavoitteiden toteutumista, poistamalla kehitystyön esteitä sekä sparraamalla niin kehitystiimiä kuin asiakasta. Tehtävän tarkempi painotus muotoutuu omien kiinnostuksen kohteidesi ja vahvuuksiesi mukaan - tärkeintä on vahva tekninen osaaminen, ehtymätön koodausinto sekä aito halu miettiä ratkaisuja asiakkaidemme hyväksi. Miltä arkesi tyypillisesti näyttää? Vastaat asiakastarpeiden ja liiketoimintavaatimusten analysoinnista sekä niiden pohjalta soveltuvan arkkitehtuurin suunnittelusta. Toimit teknisenä asiantuntijana ja arkkitehtina sekä nykyisille että potentiaalisille asiakkaille, osallistut aktiivisesti pre-sales -toimintaan yhdessä muiden asiantuntijoiden kanssa ja laadit työmääräarvioita. Lisäksi toimit Agile Delivery Leadin roolissa asiakasprojekteissa sekä fasilitoit tiimisi työtä. Vastaat ratkaisuarkkitehtuurista ja laadukkaiden ohjelmistoratkaisujen toteutuksesta – arkkitehtuurin suunnittelusta, speksaamisesta itse devaamiseen ja viimeistelyyn asti. Tavallisena työpäivänä kehität webappeja ja tech stackisi koostuu client-side Reactista & Typescriptistä ja server-side .NET/C# :sta. Sovelluksen backend juttelee yleensä jonkin Microsoftin D365 -järjestelmän kanssa ja se on deployattu Azureen (hyödyntäen palveluita kuten App Service, API Management, Functions, SQL/CosmosDB, Key Vault, jne ). Osaat tunnistaa tilanteet, joissa asiakasta on hyvä ohjata kohti teknisesti kestävämpiä ratkaisuja, ja pystyt keskustelemaan niistä joustavasti niin asiakkaiden kuin tiimin jäsenten kanssa. Sinulla on kokemusta monialaisesta tiimityöstä ja arvostat eri osaajien, kuten designereiden ja asiakasvastaavien, näkemyksiä osana kehitysprosessia. Tiimimme on organisoitu osaamisalueiden mukaan pienempiin full stack -asiakkuustiimeihin , mikä mahdollistaa tiiviin yhteistyön ja asiakaslähtöisen kehittämisen jokaisessa projektissa. Suurin osa tulevasta asiakkuustiimistäsi työskentelee Helsingissä ja Vaasassa , joten toivomme, että sijaitset ensisijaisesti näiden alueiden läheisyydessä. Fellowmindilla työtä tehdään erittäin joustavasti ja voit pitkälti itse päättää miten ja missä työskentelet. Arvostamme kuitenkin sitä, että kasvokkain tapahtuva vuorovaikutus, tiedon jakaminen ja tiimin yhteiset hetket ovat luonteva osa arkeasi. Minkälaista osaamista odotamme sinulta? 🔹Tehtävään soveltuvaa koulutusta. 🔹Yli 5 vuoden kokemusta Full Stack -kehityksestä ja kyky suunnitella sekä toteuttaa skaalautuvia ja tietoturvallisia ratkaisuja laajoihin räätälöityihin sovelluksiin yritysympäristöissä. 🔹Yli 5 vuoden kokemusta Azuren pilvipalveluista ja DevOps-käytännöistä CI/CD-ympäristössä. 🔹Laajaa kokemusta ohjelmistokehityksen eri menetelmien kirjosta aina ketterästä vesiputousmalliin - kykenet soveltamaan niitä joustavasti tavoitteiden saavuttamiseksi. 🔹Näyttöjä AI-kehityksestä osana softakehitysprojekteja. 🔹Näkemystä low-code-teknologian mahdollisuuksista. Pyrimme aina toteuttamaan asiakkaalle teknisesti järkevimmän ratkaisun, kun huomioidaan ratkaisun koko elinkaari, kokonaiskustannukset ja ylläpidettävyys. Monesti tämä tarkoittaa jonkinlaista hybridi-ratkaisua, jossa hyödynnetään ohjelmistokehityksen lisäksi low-code-teknologiaa. 🔹Erinomaiset viestintätaidot suomeksi ja englanniksi, ruotsin kielen taito plussaa. Asiakastyössä proaktiivinen ja konsultoiva ote - olemme aina askeleen edellä ja ehdotamme ratkaisuja ennen kuin niitä edes kysytään. 🔹Azure-sertifikaatit katsotaan eduksi. Miksi sinun kannattaisi valita Fellowmind? ➡️ Vahvuutemme on Microsoft -ekosysteemin tehokas hyödyntäminen. Pitkäaikainen kumppanuutemme Microsoftin kanssa kertoo paitsi teknisestä osaamisesta, myös siitä, että osaamme rakentaa asiakkaillemme arvoa läpi koko Microsoftin pilviekosysteemin. Yhdistämme uusimman teknologian, kuten AI:n, Copilotin, Dynamics 365:n ja Fabricin, rohkeuteen haastaa totutut tavat. ➡️ Fellowmind on kasvava IT-talo. Pääset mukaan rakentamaan muutosta niin asiakkaiden arjessa, teknologian ytimessä kuin siinäkin, millainen työpaikka me itse haluamme olla. Meillä työpäivät vaihtelevat ja kehitys on jatkuvaa - mutta juuri siksi täällä pääsee kehittymään, vaikuttamaan ja jättämään jälkensä siihen, miten toimimme ja kasvamme yhdessä. ➡️ Olemme tarpeeksi isoja ottamaan vastuuta isoista kokonaisuuksista, mutta tarpeeksi pieniä säilyttääksemme aidon yhteistyön ja välittämisen kulttuurin. Tavoitteenamme on kasvaa jatkuvasti, ja se tuo mukanaan muutosta - mutta emme halua menettää ketteryyttä, luottamusta tai yhdessä tekemisen fiilistä. ➡️ Tarjoamme mahdollisuuden joustavaan hybridityöhön. Työtä saa tehdä sieltä mistä haluaa, mutta silti meillä on syntynyt toimistokulttuuri, jonne moni haluaa tulla. ➡️ Päivittäinen työ on monialaista yhteistyötä yli tiimiralojen. Ympärilläsi on lähes 500 hengen joukko rautaisia asiantuntijoita niin asiakkuudenhallinnan, toiminnanohjauksen, projektinhallinnan, sovelluskehityksen sekä raportoinnin ja analytiikan saralta. Meillä opitaan toisilta, sparrataan toisiamme ja kehitetään yhdessä parempia toimintatapoja. ➡️ Always Personal, Act With Courage, Better Together ja Serious About Fun. Nämä arvomme määrittävät Fellowmindin yrityskulttuurin ytimen. Yhteinen kulttuuri ei kuitenkaan tarkoita samanlaisuutta, vaan jaettua ymmärrystä siitä, miten haluamme toimia - toisiamme kunnioittaen, avoimesti ja rennolla otteella. 👉 Omannäköisen yrityskulttuurimme vuoksi myös työehtosopimuksemme ja kattavat työsuhde-etumme ovat ihmistemme innoittamia ja yhdessä luotuja. Kiinnostaisiko keskustella kanssamme lisää? Tutustumme mielellämme sinuun paremmin! Kerrothan lisää osaamisestasi sekä kiinnostuksestasi lähettämällä meille hakemuksesi, CV:si tai LinkedIn -profiilisi yhteystietojen kera. Aloituksen suhteen olemme hyvin joustavia ja käymmekin jatkuvasti haastatteluita avoimiin tehtäviimme sekä pyrimme löytämään kiinnostuksesi pohjalta oikean roolin myös tulevaisuuden tarpeistamme. 📩 Lisätietoja Fellowmindista ja avoimista mahdollisuuksistamme antaa rekrytoijamme  Riikka Ketola ( riikka.ketola@fellowmind.fi , 040 610 2627).

Jotta työ ja vapaa-aika löytäisivät tarvitsemasi tasapainon, tarjoamme sinulle joustavat työskentelyolosuhteet ja työvälineet, jotka saat valita tarpeidesi mukaan. Edellä mainittujen lisäksi meillä on kattavat etuudet . Goforella on käytössä oma, tekijöidemme näköinen työehtosopimus. Voit tutustua siihen täällä . Palkkakehitys ja rekrytointiprosessimme Meille Goforella on tärkeää, että työstä maksetaan kunnollinen kokonaiskorvaus. Palkkaan vaikuttaa paitsi kokemus ja taidot, myös kaksi arvoamme: aktiiviset toimet sen eteen että Gofore on hyvä työpaikka kaikille sekä asiakasnäkökulman huomioiminen kaikessa tekemisessä. Oman esihenkilön kanssa käytävissä palkkakeskusteluissa keskeistä on saamasi palaute, laskutusaste (olemmehan konsultteja!) sekä oman osaamisen kehittäminen. Arkkitehtina peruskuukausipalkkasi on noin 5000-6000 €, minkä lisäksi saat bonusta kuukausittaiseen laskutusasteeseesi perustuen. Meillä on käytössä myös yrityksen menestykseen liittyviä erillisiä bonuksia, jotka voivat liittyä esimerkiksi rekrytointiin, myyntiin tai Goforen tunnettuuden kasvattamiseen.

Vahva kokemuksemme eri toimialoilta auttaa julkisen ja yksityisen sektorin asiakkaitamme onnistumaan digitaalisessa muutoksessa ja saavuttamaan tavoitteitaan entistä tehokkaammin. Koodaavaa arkkitehti teknologiamodernisoinnin automaatioratkaisuihin Etsimme tekoälynatiivia, koodaavaa arkkitehtiä, joka haluaa olla etulinjassa kehittämässä ja hyödyntämässä generatiiviseen tekoälyyn pohjautuvia ratkaisuja ohjelmistojen modernisoinnin ja ylläpidon automatisointiin. CGI:n tuotealusta automatisoi sovellusten lähdekoodin dokumentointia, analysointia ja modernisointia. Hyödynnämme generatiivista tekoälyä, agenttipohjaisia ratkaisuja ja staattista koodianalyysiä. Työkalujemme avulla dokumentoimme ja modernisoimme sekä sekä uusia että perinteisiä järjestelmiä ja automatisoimme siirtymistä kohti nykyaikaisia teknologioita ja pilviympäristöjä. Tässä roolissa pääset rakentamaan uuden sukupolven kehitystyökaluja ja viemään ne asiakkaidemme hyödyksi yhdessä tiimimme ja tuoteomistajan kanssa.
