## Job Description

NoCry is an Estonian company with a small yet powerful team doing big things.

We are one of the fastest-growing work gear brands on Amazon.

With over 5 million customers worldwide, we aim to become the global go-to source for workwear and PPE.

Our Mission is to empower hardworking people with functional and durable gear crafted from real-world needs, not boardroom decisions.

We're looking for a Junior Product Development Engineer, someone who loves building things, experimenting, learning by doing, and turning ideas into real, testable products.

If you enjoy prototyping and solving hands-on problems, and seeing your work come to life, we'd love to meet you.

Engineer and build prototypes take product ideas from sketches to functional, testable prototypes using SolidWorks and rapid prototyping tools.

Solve real-world engineering problems through creative thinking, iteration, and practical testing.

Design and develop mechanical systems and components for PPE and workwear accessories, ensuring reliability and manufacturability.

Lead root-cause analysis on design or production issues, developing practical and lasting fixes.

Continuously optimize designs for strength, cost, usability, and assembly efficiency.

Support the full development cycle from concept sketch to working prototype to production handoff.

A degree in Mechanical Engineering, Product Design, Industrial Design Engineering, or a related field.

Some experience with SolidWorks or any CAD software (student projects count!).

Basic understanding of manufacturing processes like injection molding or simple mechanical assemblies.

Curiosity, creativity, and a strong desire to build, test, learn, and improve.

Good problem-solving skills and the ability to take ownership of small projects.

Bonus points for: Experience with 3D scanning technologies for precision modeling.

Background in wearable, ergonomic, sporting, safety, or tactical gear design.

Hands-on experience with high-volume manufacturing (die casting, machining, stamping).

Joining our team offers a one-of-a-kind experience at Estonia's largest e-commerce company on Amazon.

We're on a mission to establish ourselves as a top global brand in safety gear and work apparel, and you could play a pivotal role in our journey to success.

Expect engaging and challenging work that directly influences our business outcomes.

We have hybrid working opportunities, a Stebby package, and fun team gatherings.

We're excited to receive your application if you're fueled by passion, thrive on pushing boundaries, and crave an environment that fosters innovation, freedom, and responsibility.

Don't miss this opportunity to make a meaningful difference with us!
