In fact, your work enables our teams to deliver fresh fruit, time-sensitive healthcare products and much more to people all around the world.

Working in IT at Kuehne+Nagel contributes to more than we imagine.

Are you a talented DevOps engineer with a passion for automation and solving complex challenges? Join our international team in Tallinn and play a pivotal role in building and supporting the successful delivery of value in our Road Logistics products.

The main focus of this role is development-oriented.

You will design, implement, and maintain the DevOps platform that supports the development process and release pipelines for Road Logistics applications throughout the entire software development lifecycle.

A key aspect of the role is optimizing workflows through automation and well-architected systems.

Additionally, you will be involved in migrating applications to containers and cloud environments, including OpenShift, Kubernetes, and AWS.

Ensuring the efficient utilization of cloud-based infrastructure and services across all teams is essential, preventing silos or knowledge islands.

You will also champion best practices such as observability, Infrastructure-as-Code, and GitOps, seamlessly integrating them into the existing infrastructure and processes.

How you create impact Taking part in managing non-production and production environments for Road Logistics applications.

Implementing observability pillars with centralized monitoring, logging and alerting.

Automating tasks and processes as much as possible.

Collaborating with infrastructure and product development teams to improve applications and processes.

Ensure security and compliance across all stages of the software development lifecycle.

Promoting DevOps culture and mindset.

What we would like you to bring Minimum 3 years of experience in a similar role (DevOps Engineer, SRE, or Platform Engineer).

Hands-on experience with at least one major cloud provider, preferably AWS.

Strong Linux background with experience in configuration management tools (Ansible preferred).

Proficiency in CI/CD tools, ideally Jenkins or GitLab, with experience in automation and deployment.

Scripting skills for automating routine tasks using Python, Groovy, or Bash.

Expertise in container tooling and orchestration, such as Kubernetes or OpenShift.

Ability to develop scalable solutions that do not reinvent the wheel but can rather themselves serve as blueprints for tackling similar or even new challenges.

Experience working in hybrid infrastructures, securely connecting cloud and on-premises environments, with strong collaboration skills in international teams and proficiency in English (spoken and written).

What's in it for you Join Kuehne+Nagel's IT Hub in Tallinn, where your work will have a meaningful impact on the logistics industry.

Here, you'll find a hybrid work model, extensive health benefits, and a culture of continuous learning that ensures your career growth.

You'll be surrounded by extraordinary and committed people, all dedicated to shaping the future of logistics.

Even if you don't tick every box, we encourage you to apply your unique perspective and experience could be exactly what we need.

Be part of a team that values work-life balance, supports your personal well-being, and empowers you to contribute to something truly impactful.

Who we are Logistics shapes everyday life - from the goods we consume to the healthcare we rely on.

At Kuehne+Nagel, your work goes beyond logistics; it enables both ordinary and special moments in the lives of people around the world.
