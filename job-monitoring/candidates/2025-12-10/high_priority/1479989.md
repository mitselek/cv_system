What You'll Bring:: Strong proficiency in JavaScript and TypeScript, with hands-on experience in modern frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).

Deep understanding of frontend build systems and tools (e.g., Vite, Webpack, Rollup, Nx).

Practical knowledge of CI/CD systems (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins), with a track record of building or maintaining pipelines.

Background as a frontend engineer with a focus on developer productivity, tooling, or infrastructure.

Excellent debugging and communication skills, with a collaborative approach to problem-solving.

Experience working in and maintaining large-scale frontend monorepos, preferred.

Experience with containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) and cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP), preferred.

Familiarity with developer experience metrics and a methodical approach to continuous improvement, preferred.

Experience building and maintaining internal developer tools used at scale, preferred.
