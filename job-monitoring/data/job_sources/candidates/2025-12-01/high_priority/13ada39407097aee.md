## Job Description

Join FA Solutions as one of two new Product Owners and take full ownership of a new fintech application - whether enhancing one already in motion or creating another from the ground up.

Key responsibilities: As a Product Owner, you will take ownership of one of FA platform's applications in the wealth management field-either an OMS (order management system) application already moving toward production or a brand-new Compliance application starting from scratch.

This is a primarily operational role focused on backlog management, stakeholder collaboration, and day-to-day execution.

The Product Manager owns the overall strategy, while you also have opportunities to share insights and influence direction.

You work closely with a dedicated development team, which owns its own business area, and collaborate with Product Management, UX, and other stakeholders to ensure your product evolves with high functional quality and clear business value.

The role consists of responsibilities such as release planning, discovery, requirements gathering, iterative specification, and overseeing implementation stages.

You ensure readiness for development, support the team in execution, and review releases to confirm that outcomes meet expectations and customer needs.

You also keep specifications and the application backlog up to date and ensure that Jira tickets follow our development process.

In addition, you help deliver complete solutions from individual features to larger epics, participate in documentation and product communication, and present new features internally and externally.

What makes you a great fit? You're a great fit if you have practical experience from the financial domain-ideally related to order management systems or pre-/post-trade compliance in asset or wealth management.

We also hope you have solid product development know-how that helps you understand clients' business processes, collaborate smoothly with diverse stakeholders, and translate complex needs into clear, actionable guidance for the development team.

We require you to have: Previous experience in product development roles such as Product Owner, Product Manager or Business Analyst A background in the financial domain - ideally related to order management systems or pre-/ post-trade compliance in asset or wealth management Ability to prioritise objectively and see the big picture while paying attention to detail Strong communication skills and ease working with both business and technical stakeholders A full working proficiency in English We consider as an asset: Degree in finance (MBA or similar) Previous experience as an OMS or compliance Product Owner at wealth or investment management space Familiarity with Jira Language skills in Finnish or Swedish We can offer you: A unique chance to manage one of two new applications, each with its own roadmap and development team An opportunity to influence ways of working and leave your mark Opportunities for growth: broaden or deepen your expertise, and build a career at FA Solutions The flexibility and speed of a startup, backed by the resources and stability of an established company Flexible working hours and remote work policy Lunch, sport & culture benefits, and Auntie well-being service Bonus model Practicalities: This is a full-time and permanent position (two openings), in which you will be employed directly to FA Solutions.

The ideal starting date is as soon as possible.

The company's office is located in Helsinki, but it's possible to work fully remotely (in Finland) in this role.
