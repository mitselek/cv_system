**Subject: Application for Senior Backend Engineer (m/w/d)**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Backend Engineer (m/w/d) position at Kühne + Nagel's IT Hub in Tallinn. With over 20 years of backend development experience, proven leadership in architecting scalable systems, and a track record of delivering mission-critical platforms, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the technology infrastructure powering Kuehne+Nagel's global logistics operations.

Your emphasis on backend architectural decisions, long-term maintainability, and cross-functional collaboration resonates deeply with my professional experience. At PÖFF (Black Nights Film Festival), I led a 4-member development team in architecting and maintaining the technical infrastructure for an international cultural event. The platform served multiple domains (poff.ee, justfilm.ee, kinoff.ee, industry.poff.ee, shorts.poff.ee) using a Node.js-based architecture with Strapi CMS backend and PostgreSQL database. This role required close collaboration with frontend developers, DevOps engineers, and QA experts—precisely the cross-functional teamwork your position emphasizes. I'm particularly proud that all 4 interns I mentored during this period were hired full-time, demonstrating my commitment to knowledge transfer and team development.

My experience with Spring Boot comes from my role as Senior System Analyst at Eesti Keele Instituut, where I managed the EKILEX dictionary and terminology database system development. The project utilized Spring Boot 2.6.12, Spring Framework 5.3.23, and Spring Security 5.6.7, giving me hands-on exposure to the Java/Spring ecosystem. Additionally, my work at Justiitsministeerium involved Oracle JDeveloper and Oracle ADF for Java-based enterprise applications, further strengthening my Java foundation. While I rate my Java proficiency at 7/10, my 15 years of Node.js backend development (proficiency 8/10) provides a solid foundation in API design, microservices architecture, and RESTful principles that transfer seamlessly to Java environments.

Database optimization and scalability are areas where I have demonstrated measurable impact. At Eesti Mälu Instituut, I designed and implemented a real-time data publication system using Elasticsearch and Docker containers on DigitalOcean, serving 100,000+ historical records with 5-minute latency to websites memoriaal.ee and wwii-refugees.ee. This system included isolated development, testing, and production environments, ensuring data quality and secure deployment processes. My PL/SQL proficiency (8/10), developed through extensive work with Oracle databases at Tele2's billing systems, complements my PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL experience, making me comfortable with diverse database technologies.

Regarding cloud platforms and containerization, I have deployed the Entu data management platform on AWS, serving 30+ organizations including schools, museums, and businesses since 2010. The platform is container-ready and has been used by institutions ranging from the Estonian Academy of Arts (2010-2025) to multiple school libraries across Estonia. My Elasticsearch pipeline project utilized Docker for containerization, demonstrating practical experience with production-ready container deployments.

I must be transparent about gaps in my experience: I have no production experience with Kotlin or Kubernetes, though I have strong foundations in Docker containerization and the Java ecosystem through Spring Boot. I am confident in my ability to acquire Kotlin proficiency rapidly, given my experience with multiple programming languages (Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python) and my active use of AI-assisted development tools (GitHub Copilot, MCP servers) since April 2024, which accelerate learning and adoption of new technologies.

Your company's emphasis on work-life balance, continuous learning, and meaningful impact aligns perfectly with my values. The opportunity to contribute to logistics systems that deliver essential goods globally—from fresh fruit to healthcare products—represents exactly the kind of purpose-driven work I find most fulfilling. My experience maintaining systems for international cultural events and national language resources has taught me the importance of reliability, performance, and user-centered design in mission-critical environments.

I am excited about the prospect of joining Kühne + Nagel's Tallinn IT Hub and contributing my expertise in backend architecture, team leadership, and scalable system design. I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to discussing how my experience can support your team's goals.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš
