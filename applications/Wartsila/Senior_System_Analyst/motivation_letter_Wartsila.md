Wärtsilä Oyj Abp  
Navigation Product Development Team  
Helsinki, Finland

**Subject: Application for Senior System Analyst Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior System Analyst position within Wärtsilä's Navigation product development team. With direct experience as a Senior System Analyst at Eesti Keele Instituut and 15+ years of system architecture expertise, I am drawn to the opportunity to contribute to sustainable maritime technology and the decarbonisation of the shipping industry.

My background in requirements engineering and system analysis aligns closely with the core responsibilities of this role. At Eesti Keele Instituut, I managed the technical supervision and system analysis for the EKILEX dictionary and terminology database system, where I successfully bridged development teams, stakeholders, and project requirements. This experience parallels the collaborative nature of your position, where the analyst acts as the bridge between product managers, development teams, certification authorities, and end-users.

The network infrastructure expertise you seek is demonstrated through my work at the Estonian Academy of Arts, where I planned and built the entire university's LAN infrastructure spanning multiple buildings and connecting 700+ users. This experience with TCP/IP networks, system architecture, and stakeholder coordination directly supports the technical foundation required for navigation product development.

Documentation has been a cornerstone of my career (9/10 proficiency). I have created extensive technical documentation across diverse projects, from language resources to festival logistics systems. At Tele2, I pioneered the introduction of documentation culture within the corporation. At the Estonian Memory Institute, I designed documentation systems that enabled historians to work directly with database queries. This documentation expertise, combined with my Python scripting skills (9/10 proficiency), positions me well for the technical manual compilation, knowledge base maintenance, and validation requirements of the navigation systems role.

I must be transparent about a significant gap in my background: I have no prior experience in maritime systems, navigation electronics (ECDIS/WECDIS), or marine industry standards (IMO/IHO/IEC). However, my career demonstrates a consistent pattern of rapidly mastering new domains. I have successfully adapted the Entu platform to serve 30+ organizations across wildly different sectors - from school libraries to film festivals to scientific laboratories - each requiring deep understanding of domain-specific requirements and terminology. At the Estonian Memory Institute, I built a real-time Elasticsearch pipeline serving 100,000+ historical records, learning archival science and historian workflows from scratch.

What I bring to Wärtsilä is not maritime expertise, but rather proven capabilities in requirements engineering, system analysis, technical documentation, and the analytical mindset needed to rapidly acquire domain knowledge. My experience working with certification and compliance frameworks (UML certification, government project standards at the Justice Ministry) demonstrates my ability to navigate structured processes. My 35+ years of Python scripting experience, from automating fermentation lab equipment in 1986 to modern data pipelines, shows sustained technical learning agility.

I am genuinely enthusiastic about Wärtsilä's mission to enable sustainable societies through maritime technology innovation. The opportunity to contribute to navigation systems that support 88% of world trade while advancing decarbonisation goals is deeply motivating. I am prepared for the 10-20% travel requirement and eager to learn from your exceptional team of navigation experts.

I recognize this application may be unconventional given the maritime domain gap. However, I believe my strong foundational skills in system analysis, requirements engineering, and documentation - combined with demonstrated learning agility across diverse technical domains - could provide value to your team, particularly if you are open to investing in domain training for a candidate with solid core competencies.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an interview at your convenience and welcome the opportunity to discuss how my transferable skills might complement your navigation product development team.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš
