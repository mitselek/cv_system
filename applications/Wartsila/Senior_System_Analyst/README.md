6. **Military projects:** No defense or naval project experience

**Tool Gaps:** 7. **Jira/Confluence:** No documented experience with these specific collaboration tools (though strong general documentation skills exist)

**Mitigating Factors:**

- Strong foundational skills in requirements engineering, documentation, and system analysis
- Proven ability to rapidly learn new domains (demonstrated across diverse sectors)
- Network and system architecture expertise transferable to marine systems
- Python and scripting skills applicable to navigation system validation

**Honest Assessment:**
This position requires specialized maritime domain knowledge that is completely absent from the candidate's background. While the core system analyst competencies match well (70% of required qualifications), the "Strong Plus" requirements represent fundamental domain expertise expected for this senior-level navigation systems role. The position description makes clear this is not an entry point to maritime systems but requires an experienced professional in the marine navigation domain.
