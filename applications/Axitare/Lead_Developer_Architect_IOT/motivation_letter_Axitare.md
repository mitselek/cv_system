**Subject: Application for Lead Software Developer / Architect IOT-lääkeautomaatille**

---

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the position of Lead Software Developer / Architect IOT-lääkeautomaatille at Axitare Oy. Your job description resonates deeply with my experience in system architecture leadership, cloud-native development, and building reliable platforms that directly impact users' lives.

## Why This Role

Your description emphasizes that this role affects patient safety and home care operations directly. This context is meaningful to me. Over my 30-year career, I have built systems serving educational institutions, cultural organizations, and healthcare data management platforms. I understand what it means to architect for reliability, security, and human impact—not just technical metrics.

The role's scope—architecture leadership, team guidance, and technical decision-making—aligns exactly with my background. I spent three decades designing systems from foundation to scale, leading technical teams, and making architectural choices that support long-term growth.

## Core Technical Strengths

**System Architecture (30+ years):** I have designed and implemented three major platforms from ground up:

- **Entu:** Node.js backend, MongoDB, Vue.js frontend. 15 years continuous production serving 30+ organizations (schools, museums, businesses, government). This platform demonstrates my ability to build systems that scale, evolve with requirements, and remain maintainable over time.
- **PÖFF Festival:** Technical architecture lead for international film festival (100,000+ participants). Architected Strapi CMS (Node.js), PostgreSQL schema, Docker deployment across five festival domains.
- **University Infrastructure:** Designed and built campus LAN for 700+ users, implemented cloud email migration reducing costs by 90%.

**Node.js & TypeScript (15+ years, 8/10):** Entu platform demonstrates production Node.js expertise at scale. 15 years of asynchronous architecture, API design, database integration, system scaling. TypeScript proficiency through modern development practices.

**Cloud Architecture:** AWS deployments (Entu platform, CloudFront CDN), Docker containerization (Elasticsearch real-time pipeline, 100,000+ records, 5-minute latency), cloud-native pattern understanding.

**Database Design (Oracle 8/10, PostgreSQL, MongoDB 15+ years):** Schema architecture for complex systems. PÖFF: designed PostgreSQL for festival's multi-domain complexity. Entu: MongoDB schemas for multi-tenant flexibility. Real-time Elasticsearch pipeline optimization.

**Team Leadership:** Led 4-member team at PÖFF. Mentored developers—100% of interns were hired full-time after internships completed. Comfortable providing technical vision and growing team capability.

## Addressing Learning Opportunities

Your requirements include technologies I have not used hands-on: Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm. I want to be direct about this.

**My Assessment:** These are implementation tools built on architectural concepts I understand deeply. I have designed containerized systems (Docker), implemented cloud infrastructure (AWS), and automated deployments (GitHub Actions, shell scripts). The foundational thinking is solid. Kubernetes is container orchestration. Terraform is infrastructure-as-code syntax. Helm is package management. The concepts behind them are within my grasp; the syntax and tools are learnable.

**My Commitment:** I do not expect to be expert immediately. I expect a 3-6 month ramping period with mentorship, like any architectural technology transition. After that period, I will have production proficiency.

**Your Advantage:** You get an architect who understands _why_ these tools exist and how they fit into larger system design—because I have designed those larger systems. Many Kubernetes experts lack this architectural context.

## Medical Device & Healthcare Context

Your role involves systems classified as medical devices and patient safety. You mention IEC/EN 62304 compliance and IoT domain requirements as preferred (not required).

I have no formal medical device development experience. I have designed systems for healthcare data management, built infrastructure supporting institutional operations with 700+ users, and worked in domain contexts where reliability and data security matter fundamentally.

I am not asking to bypass learning—I am confident this domain knowledge is learnable through job context and mentorship. What I bring is architectural rigor, system design thinking, and experience building systems people rely on.

## Finnish Language

I am Finnish, I speak Finnish, and I understand Finnish healthcare context. I do not have fluent Finnish language proficiency from day one. My current level is approximately "Ritari Ässä from 1990s Suomi-TV"—basic, functional, sometimes entertaining but not professional.

However, I am confident that three months of systematic study and practice—combined with daily work immersion—will develop professional Finnish proficiency. I am willing to invest in this commitment. Language learning is achievable on a 3-month timeline when combined with daily use.

## Why I Am Interested

1. **Impact:** Patient safety and home care represent meaningful work. Healthcare outcomes are real impact, not abstract metrics.

2. **Architectural Autonomy:** Your description positions this as lead-level technical decision-making, not execution-only. After 30 years of system architecture, I value autonomy to shape long-term technical direction.

3. **Team & Culture:** "Tight, skilled, straightforward team" in small company (30+ people). This is my preferred working environment—close enough to matter, large enough to be stable.

4. **Modern Tech Stack:** Kubernetes, Node.js, TypeScript, Cloud-native patterns. These are technologies I choose to work with, not reluctantly adopt.

5. **Growth Context:** "Expanding rapidly in Finland and internationally." Building systems for growth is what I do best—designing for scale from inception.

## Closing

I bring 30 years of system architecture experience, proven team leadership, Node.js and cloud expertise, and demonstrated ability to build reliable platforms. I will contribute immediately to architectural decisions and team guidance. I have genuine enthusiasm to learn Kubernetes/Terraform/medical device specifics and develop professional Finnish proficiency on a 3-month commitment timeline.

I am available for an interview at your convenience and confident this role aligns with both my capabilities and my professional interests.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš
