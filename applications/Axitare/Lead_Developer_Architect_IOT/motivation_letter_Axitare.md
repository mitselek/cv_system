Axitare Oy  
Helsinki, Malmi

**Subject: Application for Lead Software Developer / Architect IOT-lääkeautomaatille**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Lead Software Developer / Architect position at Axitare Oy. This role represents an exceptional opportunity to bring architectural leadership and technical vision to a mission-critical healthcare system - meaningful, high-reliability technical challenge I have pursued throughout my career.

**Alignment with Your Technical Vision**

Your emphasis on modern cloud-native architecture, team leadership, and security-conscious design resonates deeply with my career trajectory. Over the past 15 years, I have specialized in building scalable, reliable Node.js/TypeScript backend systems and architecting technical solutions that balance security, performance, and team capability. At PÖFF (Black Nights Film Festival), I led a 4-member development team as technical architect, establishing CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, containerizing services with Docker, and achieving a 100% conversion rate of interns to full-time team members - a testament to both technical mentoring and culture building.

**Proven Track Record in Security-Critical Systems**

I bring direct experience developing government-level security-critical systems. At the Ministry of Justice (2002-2005), I participated in building the Criminal Care Information System and Criminal Procedure Register - both mission-critical applications handling sensitive data. This foundation, combined with more recent work integrating historical data from dozens of sources at the Estonian Memory Institute (2017-2024) while maintaining data integrity and access controls, demonstrates my commitment to secure, auditable system design.

**Architectural Leadership at Scale**

I have designed and deployed systems serving 30+ organizations simultaneously (the Entu platform), requiring careful attention to multi-tenant isolation, data security, and system reliability. One achievement I am particularly proud of: implementing a real-time Elasticsearch data pipeline that serves 100,000+ historical records with just 5-minute publication latency from update to live display. This project required thinking systematically about data flow, containerization, and infrastructure-as-code - exactly the mindset required for leading a medical device IoT platform to "the next level."

**Technical Expertise**

My skill set aligns directly with your requirements:

- **Backend Architecture:** 15+ years Node.js (8/10), JavaScript (9/10), and 4+ years Java backend development
- **Modern Stack:** Daily TypeScript usage (8/10) with strict type discipline; Docker containerization; GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Cloud-Native Design:** Deployed systems on AWS, Google Cloud, and DigitalOcean; experienced with infrastructure patterns and containerization
- **Team Leadership:** Led 4-person development team with hands-on coding involvement and mentoring focus

**Addressing the Gaps with Honest Perspective**

Your job listing mentions Kubernetes/Helm, Terraform, and medical device compliance (IEC/EN 62304) as requirements. I have not deployed Kubernetes or Terraform in production, though I understand the underlying containerization and infrastructure concepts deeply. Medical device compliance is new domain knowledge for me. However, I approach these gaps not as barriers but as learning opportunities backed by my strongest assets - strong architectural fundamentals and the discipline to master new domains. The core capability - designing and leading secure, scalable, reliable systems - is exactly what I bring.

**On Finnish Language**

Regarding Finnish: my current level is quite basic, mutta ma voi oppi. Olen varmaa, et with consistent effort and exposure, musta tulee hüvä Finnish speaker suhteellisen lühüessä ajassa.

**Why This Role Matters**

Your description resonates: "This is a role where you get to influence broadly: architecture, technical choices, and development culture." This is precisely what has motivated my 23+ years in software development. I have never been interested in isolated technical optimization; I am interested in building systems and teams that matter. A pharmacy IoT platform affecting patient safety and home care quality is exactly the kind of meaningful technical challenge I want to dedicate my expertise toward.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring architectural leadership, team mentoring, and technical vision to Axitare's next phase of growth. I welcome the chance to discuss how my 23+ years of backend architecture, security-conscious design, and lead-level technical decision-making can accelerate your medical device platform.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš

**P.S.:** I am located in Estonia and am comfortable with hybrid work arrangements in Helsinki or remote work as the role requires. I am available to begin immediately and am particularly interested in the challenging technical problems inherent in medical device systems.
