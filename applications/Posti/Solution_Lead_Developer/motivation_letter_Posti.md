**Subject:** Application for Solution Lead Developer - Order Management and Orchestration Domain

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the **Solution Lead Developer** position within Posti's Order Management and Orchestration domain. With over 20 years of backend development experience spanning government systems, telecommunications billing, and real-time data platforms, I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to Posti's mission of creating smoother everyday life across the Nordic and Baltic regions.

## Why I Am a Strong Fit

Your job posting resonates deeply with my professional background and values:

### **Technical Alignment**

My career has been built on exactly the technologies you require:

- **Oracle/PL/SQL Mastery:** At Justiitsministeerium (2002-2005), I acquired a personal PL/SQL handbook and applied it to building criminal justice systems with Oracle ADF. At Tele2 (2006-2009), I "wore out that handbook" developing mission-critical billing systems in a high-volume telecommunications environment—the kind of transaction-critical, order-oriented work that parallels parcel tracking and order orchestration.

- **Python Expertise (9/10):** Most recently at Eesti Mälu Instituut, I designed an Elasticsearch real-time data pipeline serving 100,000+ historical records with 5-minute update latency. This experience with high-volume, real-time systems translates directly to order management where speed and reliability are paramount.

- **Java Proficiency (7/10):** From Oracle JDeveloper to Spring Boot project management at Eesti Keele Instituut, I understand enterprise Java patterns and their role in large-scale backend architectures.

- **AWS & Cloud Deployment:** I have deployed systems using AWS CloudFront and DigitalOcean, containerized applications with Docker, and managed isolated dev/test/prod environments—skills directly applicable to Posti's cloud infrastructure.

### **People-First Leadership**

What excites me most about this role is the emphasis on **"collaborating with people, their growth and interaction, on top of being competent with tech."** This perfectly mirrors my leadership philosophy:

At PÖFF (Black Nights Film Festival), I led a 4-member development team where I prioritized mentoring and professional growth. The result? **All 4 interns were hired full-time**—a 100% conversion rate that reflects my belief that projects succeed when people thrive.

Your commitment to **Caring Leader training** and earning the **Mental Health Friendly Workplace® label** tells me Posti values the same human-centered approach I practice daily. I see technology as a tool to solve human problems, and I believe the best solutions emerge when teams feel supported, challenged, and valued.

## What I Bring to Order Management & Orchestration

Your domain—**tracking, sending, and order management for parcels**—requires someone who understands:

1. **Transaction-Critical Systems:** My Tele2 billing work dealt with exactly this: orders, statuses, error handling, and customer-facing accuracy in a mission-critical telecommunications environment where mistakes have real consequences.

2. **Real-Time Processing:** The Elasticsearch pipeline I built proves I can design systems where data freshness matters (5-minute updates across 100k+ records).

3. **Cross-Domain Collaboration:** At PÖFF, I worked closely with product owners, content teams, and external stakeholders—exactly the collaboration model you describe with product owners and domain owners.

4. **Full SDLC Ownership:** From requirements gathering at Justiitsministeerium to production deployment at Entusiastid OÜ (serving 30+ organizations), I have managed every phase of the software lifecycle with security and maintainability in mind.

## Learning Opportunities & Honest Gaps

I want to be transparent about areas where I will bring eagerness to learn:

- **Event Streaming Architecture (Kafka):** While I have built real-time systems, I have not worked extensively with Kafka or event streaming patterns. However, my strong backend fundamentals and experience with message-driven architectures position me to ramp up quickly. I am genuinely excited to deepen this skillset within Posti's domain.

- **Logistics Industry:** I have no direct postal or parcel logistics experience, so there will be a learning curve around domain-specific business logic (routing, carrier integrations, delivery statuses). That said, I have successfully entered new domains before (criminal justice, language resources, cultural events) and consistently translate business needs into robust technical solutions.

- **AWS Specific Tools (CloudFormation, AppSync, GraphQL):** These are listed as "extra points," and while I don't have hands-on experience, I have worked with infrastructure-as-code principles and am comfortable learning AWS-native tooling.

I view these gaps not as limitations but as opportunities to grow alongside Posti's evolving tech stack.

## Why Posti? Why Now?

Three aspects of Posti's mission deeply resonate with me:

1. **Sustainability Leadership:** Your commitment to **fossil-free operations by 2030** and **net-zero emissions by 2040** aligns with my values. Technology should serve not just business outcomes but broader societal good, and I want to contribute to infrastructure that actively reduces environmental impact.

2. **Scale & Impact:** Posti affects **millions of daily lives** across the Nordics and Baltics. The idea of optimizing order orchestration for a 15,000-person logistics operation excites me—this is infrastructure work that matters.

3. **Culture of Care:** The emphasis on **Caring Leader training**, **mental well-being**, and **diversity/inclusion** signals a company that invests in people. I have always believed that sustainable technical excellence requires sustainable human practices, and Posti seems to embody this balance.

Additionally, the **hybrid work model** and upcoming **Postitalo relocation** to Helsinki city center offer a compelling opportunity for professional growth in an international setting.

## A Collaborative, Pragmatic Approach

If selected, I will bring:

- **Deep backend expertise** across your core tech stack (Oracle/PLSQL, Python, Java, AWS)
- **Proven people leadership** with a track record of mentorship and team success
- **Pragmatic problem-solving** honed over 20+ years across diverse domains
- **Enthusiasm for learning** event streaming and logistics domain nuances
- **Commitment to your caring culture** and sustainability goals

I am confident I can contribute meaningfully to Posti's order orchestration systems while growing into event-driven architecture patterns. Most importantly, I will prioritize collaboration with your product owners, domain experts, and fellow developers to ensure technical solutions serve real human needs.

## Closing

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my backend architecture experience, people-first leadership style, and eagerness to learn can support Posti's order management and orchestration goals.

I am available for a phone discussion at your earliest convenience and look forward to learning more about your team's challenges and vision.

Warm regards,

*P.S. — I am particularly curious to hear how Posti's order orchestration domain is evolving with event streaming patterns and would love to explore how real-time systems thinking (from my Elasticsearch work) might translate to parcel tracking challenges.*
