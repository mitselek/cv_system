## Why Posti?

I am drawn to Posti's **order orchestration domain** because it combines my strengths in backend architecture, database systems, and real-time processing with an opportunity to learn event streaming patterns. My experience with:

- **Oracle/PL/SQL mastery** (Justice Ministry handbook study, Tele2 billing systems)
- **Real-time data systems** (Elasticsearch pipeline with 5-min updates, 100k+ records)
- **Order/transaction systems** (Tele2 billing, festival logistics)
- **People-first leadership** (100% intern hire rate, caring mentorship)

aligns well with Posti's technical requirements and **Caring Leader culture**. While I have limited Kafka/event streaming experience, my strong backend foundation and eagerness to learn make me confident I can quickly contribute to parcel tracking and order management systems.

I admire Posti's **sustainability mission** (fossil-free 2030, net-zero 2040) and commitment to **mental well-being** (Mental Health Friendly Workplace® 2025). The hybrid model and Postitalo relocation offer an exciting Helsinki opportunity.
