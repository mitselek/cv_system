Dear Posti Talent Acquisition Team,

I am writing to apply for the Solution Lead Developer position in the Order Management and Orchestration domain, as advertised with a deadline of December 10, 2025.

With over 20 years of backend development experience and deep expertise in Oracle/PL/SQL (mastered through Justice Ministry and Tele2 billing systems), Python (9/10), and Java (7/10), I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to Posti's parcel tracking and order orchestration systems.

Key qualifications relevant to this role:

- Oracle/PL/SQL mastery: Acquired O'Reilly "Oracle PL/SQL Programming" handbook at Justice Ministry (2002-2005), extensively applied in Tele2 billing systems (2006-2009)
- Real-time systems expertise: Designed Elasticsearch pipeline serving 100,000+ records with 5-minute update latency
- People-first leadership: Led 4-member P�FF development team with 100% intern-to-employee conversion rate
- Cloud deployment experience: DigitalOcean, Docker containerization, AWS exposure
- Full SDLC experience: From requirements to deployment across government, telecom, and cultural sectors

While I have limited Kafka/event streaming experience, my strong backend foundation and eagerness to learn make me confident I can quickly contribute to your order orchestration domain.

Attached are my CV and motivation letter detailing my relevant experience and honest assessment of areas where I will bring learning enthusiasm (event streaming, logistics domain).

I am available for a phone discussion at your earliest convenience and look forward to learning more about your team's technical challenges.

Contact Information:

- Location: Tallinn, Estonia (open to Helsinki hybrid work)

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
