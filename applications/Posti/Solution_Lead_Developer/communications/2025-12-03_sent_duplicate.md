Hello Jennifer,

Thank you for taking the time to provide such a thorough explanation
regarding the Workday application process. I appreciate your patience and
the clarification about GDPR compliance and data security requirements.

After reconsidering, I am now submitting my application through Posti's
official recruitment system as required.

I remain genuinely interested in the Solution Lead Developer position and
look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my backend development
experience and people-first leadership approach could contribute to Posti's
order management and orchestration goals.

Thank you again for your understanding.

Best regards,

Lugupidamisega
