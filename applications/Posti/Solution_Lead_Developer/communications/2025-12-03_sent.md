Hello Jennifer,

Thank you for taking the time to provide such a thorough explanation regarding the Workday application process. I appreciate your patience and the clarification about GDPR compliance and data security requirements.

After reconsidering, I am now submitting my application through Posti's official recruitment system as required.

I remain genuinely interested in the Solution Lead Developer position and look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my backend development experience and people-first leadership approach could contribute to Posti's order management and orchestration goals.

Thank you again for your understanding.

Best regards,
