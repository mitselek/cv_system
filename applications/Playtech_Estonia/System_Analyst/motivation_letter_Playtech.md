**Subject: Application for System Analyst Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the System Analyst position in Playtech's Videobet unit, as advertised on CV.ee. With over 30 years of experience in software development, system analysis, and technical leadership, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team.

My experience directly aligns with your requirements. As a Senior System Analyst at Eesti Keele Instituut (2017-2018), I managed the software development of the EKILEX dictionary and terminology database system, providing technical supervision and conducting system analysis for the EKI-ASTRA project. This involved deriving requirements, coordinating with development teams, and ensuring successful project delivery - responsibilities that mirror those in your job description.

In terms of technical skills, I hold a certification in "Using UML in Object-oriented Analysis and Design" from IT-Koolitus, demonstrating my proficiency in the modeling techniques you value. My hands-on experience spans multiple programming languages and database systems including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, and Oracle. At Ilusa Koodi Instituut, I led a 4-member development team for the PÖFF (Black Nights Film Festival) platform, managing the complete technical architecture and successfully mentoring all four interns to full-time positions.

While I do not have prior experience in the iGaming industry, I bring strong transferable skills from complex, user-facing platforms. My work on the PÖFF festival platform - serving an international audience across multiple domains (poff.ee, justfilm.ee, kinoff.ee) - demonstrates my ability to understand complete product contexts and deliver quality software in demanding environments. I am genuinely enthusiastic about learning the gaming domain and applying my analytical and technical skills to Videobet's product development.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in system analysis, database design, and technical leadership can benefit Playtech's Videobet team. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš
