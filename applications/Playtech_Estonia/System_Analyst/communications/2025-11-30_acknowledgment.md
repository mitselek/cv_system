Hi&nbsp;Mihkel,
Thank you for submitting your application for the position of System Analyst [021366].
We are reviewing all the applications carefully and will come back to you as soon as possible. However please note, due to the high volumes of applications we do experience, we would love to respond to all applicants individually, but it sometimes is unfeasible. If you do not hear from us about your application within 2 weeks, unfortunately it should be considered your application was unsuccessful.
We would like to say thank you for your effort and your interest in our company.
In the meantime, if you need to manage/edit your application details (or even withdraw or delete your account), please access your SmartRecruiters user profile. Use the email you applied with and a one-time passcode to log in (please check your Spam folder if you do not see an email from SmartRecruiters with a one-time passcode). If you encounter any difficulties, we would be happy to assist you at People@playtech.com.
Best regards,
Playtech Talent Acquisition Team
