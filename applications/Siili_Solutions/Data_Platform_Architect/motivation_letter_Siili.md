**Subject: Application for Data Platform Architect**

---

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to apply for the Data Platform Architect position at Siili Solutions. Your statement "WE MAKE AI REAL" resonates deeply with me. Since April 2024, I have been actively integrating AI tools into my development workflow - not as an experiment, but as a fundamental shift in how I approach software architecture and data systems.

## Why Siili

Your AI-centric strategy focusing on three areas - staying on the cutting edge with GenAI, transforming ways of working, and envisioning impactful Data and AI solutions - describes exactly the direction I have been pursuing independently.

I have built an autonomous development team simulation (ai-team repository) that develops software following industry best practices. I created an AI-powered job application system with structured prompts, fact-checking agents, and automated document generation. These are not theoretical exercises - they are production tools I use daily.

When you say you are "reinventing the value chain and commercial models of software development through AI," I understand this viscerally because I have been doing it.

## Technical Alignment

My experience aligns with your requirements:

**Data Platform Architecture:** At Eesti Mälu Instituut, I designed and implemented a complete data publication pipeline based on Elasticsearch, serving 100,000+ records with 5-minute sync cycle. The system included isolated development, testing, and production environments using Docker containers.

**Cloud Deployments:** The Entu platform I architected is deployed on AWS, serving 30+ organizations including schools, museums, and businesses. At POFF, I led deployment to AWS CloudFront for a platform spanning multiple festival domains.

**Python and SQL:** Python is my strongest programming language (9/10). I thoroughly mastered PL/SQL (8/10) while working on Tele2 billing systems - I acquired the O'Reilly handbook and, as I like to say, wore it out through daily use.

**Team Leadership:** At POFF, I led a 4-member development team. All 4 interns I mentored were hired full-time after completing their internships.

## Addressing the Finnish Gap

I want to be direct: I do not yet speak fluent Finnish. My current level comes from years of watching Finnish television - minä katsosin Ritari Ässää suomen teeveessä.

I am a proven language learner. I speak Latvian at C2 level - a language with no structural similarity to my native Estonian. Finnish and Estonian share Finno-Ugric roots, vocabulary patterns, and grammatical structures. Given this foundation and my commitment to intensive study, I am confident I can achieve professional fluency within three months.

I understand this is a significant commitment. I am making it because Siili represents exactly the kind of organization where I want to build the next phase of my career - one that takes AI seriously, values data architecture, and invests in people.

## Why Now

I have spent 20+ years building data systems - from government registers at the Ministry of Justice to real-time pipelines serving historical research. What excites me about Siili is the opportunity to combine this experience with AI capabilities in ways that create measurable business value.

Your partnerships with Microsoft, Databricks, and Nvidia, combined with your culture of continuous learning, would give me access to tools and knowledge that would accelerate both my contribution and my growth.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my data platform experience and AI tools expertise could contribute to Siili's projects.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš
