## WE MAKE AI REAL

Siili is at the forefront of AI-powered digital development. Here, AI isn't just a buzzword - it's embedded in our daily work. We are implementing our AI centric strategy by focusing on three key areas:

- Staying on the cutting edge with the latest technical innovations, like Generative AI, which are set to transform our society in unprecedented ways, while continually developing our competencies.
- Transforming our own ways of working, focusing on reinventing the value chain and commercial models of software development through AI.
- Strengthening our ability to envision impactful and ethical Data & AI solutions for our customers to maximize our influence.

At Siili, we bring humans and data together in impactful ways. We bring value to our customers by helping them uncover hidden opportunities in their existing data and turn business needs into actionable data-driven solutions. You'll work on modern data and AI initiatives-from real-time pipelines to GenAI applications and enterprise ML platforms-often tied to strategic business KPIs. While we're tech-agnostic, our go-to tools include Azure, AWS, Databricks, and Snowflake.

## What will you do as a Data Platform Architect at Siili?

As a Data Platform Architect at Siili, you'll take a central role in helping our clients succeed in their data and AI journeys. This is not only about designing technical blueprints - it's about shaping solutions that truly support business needs and bring measurable value.

You'll work closely with business stakeholders, data engineers, and development teams to understand goals and translate them into modern, cloud-native data platforms that are scalable, secure, and future-proof. You'll be defining the architectural vision, sets the standards, and ensures that data flows seamlessly across the organization. At the same time, you'll be hands-on enough to guide and mentor teams, helping them solve challenges in data pipelines, governance, and operations.

In this role, you combine strategic thinking with practical action: aligning big-picture architecture with everyday decisions, so that data platforms are not just well-designed but also deliver real outcomes.

## What we're looking for

We are now looking for an experienced Data Platform Architect to join our Data & AI community. In this role, you will combine architectural leadership with hands-on expertise to design and guide the development of modern, cloud-native data platforms.

We hope you recognize yourself in most of these:

- Strong background in data engineering or architecture, with several years of experience in designing and implementing large-scale data solutions.
- Proven skills in building data platforms on cloud environments (Azure or AWS), and familiarity with tools such as Databricks, Snowflake, or similar.
- Ability to define architectures, patterns, and best practices for data pipelines, governance, and platform operations.
- Hands-on coding experience with Python and SQL, plus understanding of DevOps practices, CI/CD, and infrastructure-as-code.
- Knowledge of data governance, security, and compliance in enterprise environments.
- Communication skills to work smoothly with both business stakeholders and technical teams.
- Fluent in Finnish and English, as many of our projects require both.

## What we offer?

- **A technically strong and collaborative community:** You'll work alongside experienced data professionals who support each other, share insights, and aim for excellence in everything we do. Our culture values respect, autonomy, and peer-driven improvement.
- **Opportunities to lead and influence:** Whether you're passionate about architecture, data platforms, or AI enablement, you'll have the freedom to take ownership and shape solutions that matter.
- **Continuous learning, backed by top partnerships:** We invest in your growth through mentoring, training, and hands-on access to the latest tools via our partnerships with Microsoft, Databricks, Nvidia and more.
- **Real-world impact, not just buzzwords:** You'll help deliver scalable, meaningful Data & AI solutions with clear ties to business strategy - not just experimental prototypes.
- **Practical benefits:** On top of company (share)option program, we support your well-being with flexibility, hobby clubs, and family-friendly services like daycare services for sick children.
- **Company with a mission:** We have a clear vision and purpose, and unique opportunity for you to make your mark as we shape the Data & AI story for a leading IT service company.
- **A culture shaped by Joy, Ambition, Responsibility and a Humane touch:** At Siili, we believe that great results stem from meaningful work, psychological safety, and the courage to act responsibly. You'll be trusted, supported and encouraged to grow as your authentic self - while contributing to a more sustainable digital future.

At Siili, you're not just solving data problems. You are shaping the future. Join us to build solutions that matter and grow your expertise in a community that supports you.
