### Identified Gaps

**GAP: Finnish Language (Critical)**
Knowledge base contains no Finnish language entry. Candidate has basic comprehension from Finnish TV exposure (Suomen Televisio, including "Ritari Ässä"). Given linguistic proximity to Estonian (native) and proven language learning ability (Latvian C2), candidate commits to intensive Finnish training with target fluency in 3 months.

**GAP: Databricks/Snowflake**
No direct experience with these specific tools. However, extensive experience with similar data platforms: Elasticsearch (100,000+ records), PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle.

**GAP: Formal CI/CD Tooling**
Experience with Docker containers and deployment automation, but no explicit mention of Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Terraform, or similar in knowledge base.
