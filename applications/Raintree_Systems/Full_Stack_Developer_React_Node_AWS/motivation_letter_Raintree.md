Raintree Systems OÜ  

**Subject: Application for Full Stack Developer (React, Node, AWS)**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack Developer position (React, Node, AWS) at Raintree Systems OÜ. With 15+ years of hands-on JavaScript/TypeScript development, extensive AWS cloud experience, and proven expertise in leading technical architecture for platforms serving 30+ organizations, I am confident I can make immediate contributions to your growing engineering team.

**My Full-Stack Expertise Aligned to Your Needs:**

Your job description emphasizes cutting-edge technologies (AWS Serverless, GraphQL, CI/CD via GitHub Actions, event-driven architecture), greenfield projects, and the opportunity to modernize legacy systems. These align perfectly with my professional journey:

- **React & TypeScript Proficiency:** I maintain JavaScript at 9/10 and TypeScript at 8/10 proficiency. Most recently, I've been active in TypeScript development (Estonian Museum Map App), applying interface-first design patterns and strict typing disciplines. My Vue.js frontend experience on the Entu platform demonstrates component architecture thinking—directly transferable to React.

- **AWS Cloud Architecture:** I've deployed cloud-based architectures on AWS for the Entu platform, supporting 30+ organizations across schools, museums, and businesses. For the PÖFF Festival platform, I led technical architecture using AWS CloudFront for CDN and global distribution, demonstrating hands-on cloud deployment experience beyond theory.

- **CI/CD & Modern DevOps:** I architected the PÖFF platform's CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions—exactly matching your stack. I understand automation, deployment patterns, and infrastructure-as-code mindsets that enable 250+ releases monthly (as you mention in your greenfield context).

- **Microservices & Event-Driven Architecture:** My system architecture background includes designing microservices patterns and cloud-ready deployment models. The Entu platform's containerization and AWS deployment demonstrate this thinking at scale.

- **Node.js Backend Mastery:** With 15+ years of Node.js API backend development, I bring deep understanding of async patterns, database integration (MongoDB, PostgreSQL), and RESTful architecture. This experience will accelerate my understanding of AWS Lambda functions and serverless patterns—extending Node.js expertise into serverless compute.

**Why I'm Excited About Raintree:**

Your emphasis on "work that directly improves people's lives with better healthcare outcomes" resonates deeply. After 30+ years in IT leadership, I appreciate the rare opportunity to contribute to healthcare software that matters. The hybrid Tartu location is ideal (no relocation needed), and your commitment to mentorship and continuous learning aligns with how I approach technical growth.

**Gaps & Learning Commitment:**

I want to be transparent: I haven't worked with GraphQL APIs directly—my API expertise is REST-focused. However, with my strong JavaScript/TypeScript foundation and experience learning new technologies quickly, GraphQL concepts will be straightforward to master. I appreciate that Raintree explicitly offers AWS certification support; I'm committed to pursuing relevant certifications to formalize my cloud expertise.

**Moving Forward:**

I'm ready to contribute immediately to your modern development practices and continuous learning culture. I'm available for an interview at your convenience and excited to discuss how my full-stack expertise can accelerate your greenfield projects and platform modernization efforts.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to join the Raintree team.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš
