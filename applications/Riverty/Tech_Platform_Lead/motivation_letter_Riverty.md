Riverty  
Tech Platform Lead Position

**Subject: Application for Tech Platform Lead**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Tech Platform Lead position at Riverty. With over 30 years of software development experience, including proven technical leadership and full-stack expertise across Node.js, Python, and Java, I am confident I can contribute significantly to your platform's technical vision and team development.

My most recent leadership role as Development Lead at Ilusa Koodi Instituut (2021-2024) demonstrates my ability to lead technical teams and deliver complex platforms. I led a 4-member development team building the PÖFF (Black Nights Film Festival) platform, overseeing the entire technical architecture for an international cultural event serving multiple domains (poff.ee, justfilm.ee, kinoff.ee, industry.poff.ee, shorts.poff.ee). The platform utilized Node.js with Strapi CMS, PostgreSQL, and modern frontend technologies. I'm particularly proud that all 4 interns I mentored during this project were hired full-time afterward, reflecting my commitment to developing engineering talent.

Your requirement for strong knowledge of both frontend and backend technologies aligns perfectly with my experience. I have 15+ years of Node.js backend development (proficiency 8/10), building API backends for the Entu platform that currently serves 30+ organizations including schools, museums, and businesses. My frontend expertise includes Vue.js and JavaScript (proficiency 9/10), demonstrated through the Entu platform's frontend and PÖFF's multi-domain static site generation. Additionally, I have solid Java experience (proficiency 7/10) from my work with Spring Boot at Eesti Keele Instituut (2017-2018) and Oracle ADF at the Ministry of Justice (2002-2005), as well as extensive Python experience (proficiency 9/10) for data pipelines and automation.

My system architecture experience spans three decades. As Head of IT Department at Eesti Kunstiakadeemia (2009-2012), I planned and built a campus-wide LAN infrastructure connecting 700+ users across multiple buildings, migrated the entire university's email system to Google Mail (reducing IT costs by 90%), and implemented the Entu platform for inventory management (5000+ assets) and document archiving (500+ documents annually). At Eesti Mälu Instituut (2017-2024), I designed and implemented a real-time Elasticsearch data pipeline serving 100,000+ records with 5-minute latency, using Docker containers on DigitalOcean. These experiences demonstrate my ability to design scalable, reliable systems and ensure best practices in performance and security.

I have experience with cloud platforms, particularly AWS (CloudFront for PÖFF, cloud-based deployments for Entu) and DigitalOcean (Elasticsearch pipeline). My DevOps capabilities include Docker containerization, shell scripting for CI/CD, and database backup automation. While my documented experience with Azure and GCP is limited, I understand cloud platform concepts are portable, and I'm eager to expand my expertise in these areas.

Regarding your fintech industry preference, while I don't have direct fintech experience, I worked extensively with billing systems at Tele2 (2006-2009), developing invoicing solutions and handling financial data. I understand the critical importance of security, compliance, and accuracy in financial systems. My track record of delivering reliable systems across diverse domains—from government (Ministry of Justice criminal care systems) to education (700-user university infrastructure) to culture (international festival platform)—demonstrates my ability to adapt technical solutions to industry-specific requirements.

I am a strong communicator with English proficiency at C2 level (reading, writing, listening) and C1 level (speaking, presentation). My role at Entusiastid OÜ involves regular client communication and business analysis for 30+ organizations, and my work at PÖFF required collaboration with international contributors. I excel in fast-paced environments, as evidenced by managing the annual deadline-driven PÖFF festival platform and juggling multiple concurrent projects at Entusiastid.

I am also committed to continuous learning. Since April 2024, I have actively adopted AI tools (GitHub Copilot, MCP, LLM APIs) to enhance development efficiency, and I recently obtained MikroTik MTCNA (February 2025) and MTCIPv6E (October 2025) certifications. This demonstrates my dedication to staying current with industry trends and integrating new technologies.

I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to own the technical vision for Riverty's payment methods, apps, portals, and checkout APIs. Leading design, development, deployment, and operations while mentoring engineering teams aligns perfectly with my experience and passion. I am particularly drawn to Riverty's inclusive culture, emphasis on work-life balance, and commitment to professional development.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical leadership, full-stack expertise, and proven track record of delivering scalable platforms can contribute to Riverty's success. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš
