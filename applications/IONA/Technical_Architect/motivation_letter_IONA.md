**Subject: Application for Technical Architect (Finland)**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Technical Architect position at IONA. I learned about this opportunity through Duunitori and am excited about the prospect of joining your award-winning ecommerce consultancy to help build next-generation composable commerce solutions.

With 15+ years of software architecture experience and a proven track record in building scalable, API-first platforms, I believe I can contribute significantly to IONA's growth and client success. My expertise in Node.js/JavaScript architecture, microservices design, and technical leadership aligns well with your requirements for this role.

My most relevant experience comes from two long-term platform projects. At Entusiastid OÜ (2010-present), I have architected and developed the Entu data management platform, which now supports 30+ organizations across Estonia. The platform follows modern architectural patterns: Node.js API backend, Vue.js frontend, and MongoDB database. This 15-year journey has taught me how to design systems that scale, evolve with changing requirements, and remain maintainable over time.

More recently, at Ilusa Koodi Instituut (2021-2024), I led a 4-member development team building the digital infrastructure for PÖFF (Black Nights Film Festival). We used a headless architecture with Strapi CMS backend and static site generation, serving multiple domains (poff.ee, justfilm.ee, kinoff.ee, industry.poff.ee, shorts.poff.ee). This project required balancing technical excellence with tight festival deadlines and diverse stakeholder needs. I'm particularly proud that all 4 interns I mentored during this project were hired full-time, demonstrating my commitment to developing technical talent.

Earlier in my career, I managed IT infrastructure at the Estonian Academy of Arts (2009-2012), where I planned and built a campus-wide LAN connecting 700+ users and migrated the entire university to Google Mail, reducing email costs by 90%. I also have experience with Java-based enterprise systems from my time at the Ministry of Justice (2002-2005), where I worked on criminal care information systems using Oracle ADF.

While I have extensive experience with API-first architecture, microservices patterns, and database modeling, I acknowledge that I don't have specific experience with commercetools or other ecommerce platforms mentioned in your requirements. However, I have successfully adapted to new domains throughout my career and am confident I can quickly learn ecommerce-specific patterns. My strength lies in understanding fundamental architectural principles and applying them effectively to any domain.

Regarding the Finnish language requirement, I am fluent in Estonian (native), English (C1-C2), Latvian (C2), and Russian (B2). While I don't currently speak Finnish, I am eager to learn, especially given the linguistic similarities between Estonian and Finnish. My strong English proficiency should enable effective communication with your international team and clients while I develop Finnish language skills.

I am excited about IONA's focus on composable commerce and MACH architecture. The opportunity to mentor globally distributed developers, collaborate with sales teams on solution design, and work with clients like Marimekko, Harvia, and Vaisala is exactly the kind of impactful work I'm seeking. Your recognition as one of Finland's fastest-growing companies demonstrates the quality of your work and the strength of your team.

Regarding salary expectations, given my 15+ years of architecture experience and proven leadership track record, I would be seeking compensation in the upper range of your stated €6,500-7,500 bracket.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in platform architecture, technical leadership, and team mentoring can contribute to IONA's continued growth. I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to learning more about your home assignment process.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš
