Hi there Mihkel,

Thank you for your interest in the Technical Architect (Commerce Solutions) role at IONA. We appreciate the time you took to apply and share your background with us.

In this role, communication plays a central part in daily work. The new team member will collaborate closely with clients in Finland and internal stakeholders, facilitate workshops, write documentation and contribute to planning and development discussions. Most of this collaboration takes place in both Finnish and English.

Because of this, we are focusing our search on candidates who feel fully confident working in both Finnish and English in professional settings, including meetings, written communication and client-facing work. Based on this essential language requirement, we have decided not to move forward with your application for this role.

IONA values people with different kinds of experience, and as the company continues to grow and expands internationally, there is a good chance that future opportunities will have different language requirements.

Please continue to check our career site for other available opportunities. We wish you the best of luck in your job search.

Best regards
