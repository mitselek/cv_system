## Application Strategy

**Recommended Approach: Honest Career Transition with Transferable Strengths**

This position represents a significant domain shift from civilian IT project management to defense-sector cyber operations. However, strong transferable skills exist:

1. **Lead with PM Expertise:** Emphasize direct IT project management experience managing complex systems, timelines, budgets, and teams

2. **Highlight Critical Systems Work:** Focus on Justice Ministry experience managing government IT systems with high reliability requirements, demonstrating ability to handle mission-critical infrastructure

3. **Demonstrate Technical Depth:** Show system architecture, infrastructure, and technical leadership capabilities that transfer to defense environments

4. **Acknowledge Gaps Transparently:** Clearly state lack of cyber security background while expressing commitment to rapid learning

5. **Express Strategic Interest:** Communicate genuine interest in contributing to Estonian state defense through IT expertise, while being realistic about required domain onboarding

6. **Emphasize Clearance Readiness:** If applicable, note willingness and readiness to undergo background investigation for state security clearance
