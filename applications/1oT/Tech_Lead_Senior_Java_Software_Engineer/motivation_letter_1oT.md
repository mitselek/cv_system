**Subject: Application for Tech Lead / Senior Java Software Engineer**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Tech Lead / Senior Java Software Engineer position at 1oT. With 20+ years of backend development, proven technical leadership, and a 100% intern hiring success rate, I am eager to contribute to your eSIM platform.

My Java and Spring expertise spans enterprise and modern frameworks. At the Ministry of Justice (2002-2005), I built government security systems using Oracle ADF. At the Estonian Language Institute (2017-2018), I managed the EKILEX project using Spring Boot 2.6.12 and Spring Security 5.6.7. My database proficiency is strong—at Tele2 (2006-2009), I achieved 8/10 PL/SQL expertise working on billing systems.

The Tech Lead role aligns perfectly with my experience. At PÖFF (2021-2024), I led a 4-member team and mentored interns with exceptional results: all 4 were hired full-time after their internships. This taught me to identify potential, provide constructive feedback, and create environments where engineers thrive.

Your emphasis on API architecture matches my 15 years developing API-driven systems at Entusiastid OÜ, where I built the Entu platform serving 30+ organizations. Both Entu and PÖFF platforms demonstrate my understanding of clean API contracts, versioning, and designing for diverse consumers. I also have Vue.js experience from Entu's frontend, though backend architecture and mentoring are my core strengths.

For cloud infrastructure, I have AWS experience from Entu deployments and Docker expertise from building an Elasticsearch pipeline (2020) serving 100,000+ records with 5-minute latency. While I haven't used Terraform or Grafana specifically, my career demonstrates rapid adaptation—from government systems to language resources to film festivals. I'm also honest about gaps: no cryptography/HSM or eSIM/IoT domain experience. However, at the Estonian Memory Institute, I trained historians to run MySQL queries directly—proving I can bridge technical and domain expertise quickly.

What excites me about 1oT is combining cutting-edge eSIM technology with architectural decisions and team mentorship—all areas where I excel. I appreciate that you value practical experience, and my diverse project history demonstrates I deliver working solutions that meet business needs.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to 1oT's platform development.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš
