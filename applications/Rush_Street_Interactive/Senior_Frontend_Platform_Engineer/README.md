2. **Developer Experience Focus:** RSI's emphasis on "friction point identification" and "workflow optimization" mirrors my PÖFF work where I built deployment automation that eliminated manual processes and my Elasticsearch pipeline work with Docker-based isolated environments.

3. **Innovation Culture:** RSI's "free-thinker" culture and rapid product innovation (PropPacks, poker network, payment solutions) requires platform teams that enable fast, reliable delivery - matching my track record of building tools that accelerate team productivity.

4. **Entertainment-First Mindset:** Working in entertainment (PÖFF film festival) taught me that technical excellence serves user delight - RSI's "entertainment business" philosophy resonates with platform work that ultimately enables better player experiences.
