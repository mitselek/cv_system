**Rush Street Interactive LLC**  
Senior Frontend Platform Engineer Position

---

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the **Senior Frontend Platform Engineer** position at Rush Street Interactive. With 15 years of experience building platforms and tools that enable engineering teams to work more efficiently, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your frontend platform infrastructure and developer experience initiatives.

## Why Platform Engineering Resonates with Me

Throughout my career, I've been drawn to the intersection of **infrastructure, tooling, and developer enablement** rather than direct product feature development. This mindset has shaped my professional journey:

For the past 15 years, I've led the **Entu Platform** - a data management system now serving 30+ organizations. This wasn't about building a single product; it was about creating a **comprehensive tooling ecosystem** that empowers organizations to manage their data effectively. The platform includes an API server, CMS, static site generator, plugin system, and migration tools - each designed to remove friction and enable developers to build without fighting their tools.

This is precisely the developer-centric philosophy your role description emphasizes: **"Creating cleaner, faster, and more resilient workflows, robust automation and reliable pipelines are essential to productive software development."** I couldn't agree more.

## Practical Experience in Platform & Infrastructure

### CI/CD & Automation

At **PÖFF (Black Nights Film Festival)**, I led the development infrastructure for one of Europe's largest film festivals. I implemented:

- **Deployment automation** using shell scripts and GitHub Actions
- **Multi-domain platform architecture** (5 festival domains: poff.ee, justfilm.ee, kinoff.ee, industry.poff.ee, shorts.poff.ee)
- **AWS CloudFront CDN** integration for global content delivery
- **Database backup and recovery workflows** ensuring zero-downtime deployments

These weren't just technical implementations - they were about **removing friction for the development team** I led, enabling them to deploy confidently and iterate quickly.

### Docker & Cloud Infrastructure

At the **Estonian Memory Institute**, I designed and deployed a **real-time data pipeline** using:

- **Docker containerization** on DigitalOcean for isolated development, testing, and production environments
- **Elasticsearch** serving 100,000+ historical records with 5-minute update latency
- **Custom Python automation scripts** for data synchronization
- **JavaScript-based frontend integration** for read-only web access

This project taught me the importance of **infrastructure that scales gracefully** and provides clear separation between environments - critical lessons for any platform engineering role.

### Developer Tooling at Scale

The **Entu Platform's 30+ organizational deployments** required building tools that work at scale:

- **API-first architecture** enabling flexible integration without vendor lock-in
- **Plugin system (Vue.js components)** allowing extensions without core modifications
- **Import and migration tools** that make onboarding new organizations frictionless
- **Multi-tenant architecture** that balances customization with maintainability

I've learned that **great tooling is invisible** - developers should focus on solving problems, not fighting their infrastructure.

## Team Collaboration & Mentoring

Platform engineering isn't a solitary endeavor. At PÖFF, I led a **4-member development team** with a focus on growth and collaboration. I'm particularly proud that **all 4 interns I mentored were hired full-time** after their internships ended. This wasn't just about technical skills - it was about:

- **Identifying friction points** in their workflows and addressing them proactively
- **Sharing knowledge** through documentation, code reviews, and pair programming
- **Fostering a culture of continuous improvement** where everyone feels empowered to suggest better ways of working

Your role description mentions **"Partner with product engineering teams to identify friction points in build, test, and deployment processes"** and **"Act as an advocate for continuous improvement and operational excellence."** This is exactly how I approach team collaboration.

## Technical Alignment & Learning Mindset

### Current Strengths

- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** 15+ years, 9/10 proficiency - core language expertise
- **Node.js:** 15 years of backend development, API design, microservices architecture
- **Vue.js:** Production experience on multiple projects (Entu, PÖFF)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, deployment automation, shell scripting
- **Docker:** Production deployments with environment isolation
- **AWS:** CloudFront CDN, cloud-based deployments

### Eager to Deep-Dive

- **Vite & Nx:** I have experience with build systems and modern frontend tooling, but I'm excited to master these specific tools in a large-scale monorepo context
- **Kubernetes:** My Docker experience provides a solid foundation, and I'm ready to scale to orchestration at production levels
- **Developer experience metrics:** I've optimized workflows based on team feedback, but I'm eager to learn methodical approaches to measuring and improving developer productivity

I believe the best platform engineers are **perpetual learners** who stay curious about new tools and approaches. My 15-year track record of platform evolution (Python to Node.js, adapting to new frameworks, continuous infrastructure improvements) demonstrates this mindset.

## Why Rush Street Interactive?

Your emphasis on **developer autonomy, creativity, and personal growth** aligns perfectly with my values. I thrive in environments where:

- **Proactive team members** are valued over passive order-takers
- **Collaboration and having fun** are part of the engineering culture
- **Professional and personal growth** are supported, not just expected

The fact that you're a **rapidly growing company in an emerging industry** is particularly exciting. Platform engineering has maximum impact in growth environments - the systems we build today shape how teams scale tomorrow.

## What I Bring to the Role

1. **Platform Development DNA:** 15 years proving I think in systems, not features
2. **Infrastructure Mindset:** CI/CD, Docker, AWS, automation - production-proven
3. **Developer Empathy:** I've led teams, mentored interns, and built tools developers actually want to use
4. **Collaborative Approach:** Cross-functional work, documentation, technical guidance
5. **Continuous Improvement:** Track record of evolving platforms based on user needs

I'm not just looking for a job - I'm looking for a role where I can **multiply the effectiveness of engineering teams** through thoughtful platform architecture, automation, and developer-centric tooling. This is what I've been doing for 15 years, and it's what I'm genuinely passionate about.

## Next Steps

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss:

- How my platform development experience can accelerate your frontend infrastructure initiatives
- Specific friction points your engineering teams face today and how I might address them
- Your vision for developer experience improvements and tooling evolution

I'm available for an interview at your convenience and can provide additional examples of my platform work, code samples, or references from team members I've mentored.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Rush Street Interactive's mission of building ground-breaking products in this exciting industry.

Best regards,

**Mihkel Putrinš**
