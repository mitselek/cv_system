Dear Hiring Team at DataShift,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Project Manager position at DataShift. With over 30 years of experience managing complex projects, leading cross-functional teams, and bridging creative and technical workflows, I believe I can contribute significantly to your team's success.

## Why I'm a Strong Fit

**Proven Project Management Experience**

My work as Project Coordinator and Team Leader at PÖFF (2021-2024) demonstrates my ability to manage complex projects under pressure. During Estonia's largest international film festival, I coordinated a team of 5+ professionals across multiple departments, managing timelines, communications, and deliverables in a high-stakes environment. This experience closely mirrors the coordination challenges of managing web projects across developers, designers, and stakeholders.

At the Estonian Academy of Arts (2009-2012), I led major technical projects including migrating 1000+ mailboxes to Gmail, implementing a new intranet system, and constructing campus-wide LAN infrastructure. These projects required meticulous planning, stakeholder communication, and managing dependencies across technical and non-technical teams—skills directly applicable to web project management.

**Deep Understanding of Content Creation Processes**

My 10+ years of professional design and layout experience (1993-1999, 2010-present) gives me a unique advantage in understanding content creation workflows. Having worked as both designer and project manager at multiple agencies (Oopus Disaini, Oopus Repro, Den za Dnjom, BalticWindow), I understand the creative process from the inside out. This background allows me to communicate effectively with designers, anticipate potential bottlenecks, and ensure smooth coordination between creative and technical teams.

**Strong Communication and Organization**

I am highly organized and excel at seeing projects through from start to finish. My C2 English proficiency (verified) ensures clear communication in international contexts, and my experience coordinating cross-border projects at BalticWindow (1998-2010) demonstrates my ability to manage distributed teams. I thrive in environments where multiple projects run simultaneously and prioritization is critical.

## Areas for Growth

I want to be transparent about areas where I'll need to develop:

**Jira Experience:** While I haven't used Jira specifically, I am comfortable learning new project management tools and have successfully adopted various systems throughout my career. I am confident I can become proficient quickly, as the underlying principles of task management and workflow coordination are familiar to me.

**A/B Testing:** I don't have direct experience conducting A/B tests, but I am genuinely excited to learn this skill. My technical background (database management, system architecture) provides a strong foundation for understanding data-driven decision-making, and I am eager to apply these analytical methods to user experience optimization.

**Marketing Copywriting:** While I have strong written communication skills, my copywriting experience is more technical/documentation-focused than marketing-oriented. However, my design background gives me a solid understanding of how visual and textual content work together to engage audiences. I see this as an area where I can grow alongside your team.

## Why DataShift?

DataShift's focus on innovative solutions and commitment to excellence aligns perfectly with my career trajectory. I am particularly drawn to your emphasis on cutting-edge ideas and professional growth. The opportunity to work on web projects that shape the future of technology, while developing new skills in A/B testing and marketing content, is exactly the kind of challenge I'm seeking at this stage of my career.

Your modern office in the city center, international conference opportunities, and comprehensive benefits package demonstrate a commitment to employee well-being that I deeply value. I am especially excited about the prospect of contributing to projects that have measurable impact and working with a team that values both innovation and collaboration.

## Next Steps

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team and contributing to DataShift's innovative projects.

Sincerely,
