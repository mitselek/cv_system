## Email Body

Dear WeCon Oy,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Backend Developer position at EWQ Zone Oy (reference from your job posting).

I bring 20+ years of backend development experience with strong expertise in:

- Node.js (15 years, 8/10 proficiency)
- MongoDB (15 years as primary database)
- Docker containerization
- Backend architecture and infrastructure
- AI tools (GitHub Copilot, MCP servers, since April 2024)

I have built and maintained production systems serving 30+ organizations, led development teams, and implemented real-time data pipelines handling 100,000+ records.

I am transparent that while I have extensive Node.js expertise, I do not have professional PHP experience. However, my 20+ years across multiple backend languages (Node.js, Python, Java, .NET) demonstrates my ability to adapt quickly to new technologies.

Please find attached my CV and motivation letter. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Best regards,  
Mihkel Putrinš
