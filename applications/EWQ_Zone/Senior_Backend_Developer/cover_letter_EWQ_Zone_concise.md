Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Senior Backend Developer position at EWQ Zone Oy through your TeamTailor system as requested.

I bring 20+ years of backend development with strong Node.js (15 years), MongoDB (15 years), and Docker expertise. While I don't have professional PHP experience, my extensive work across multiple backend languages (Node.js, Python, Java, .NET) demonstrates adaptability, and I'm committed to rapidly developing PHP proficiency.

Please find attached my CV and motivation letter detailing my relevant experience and honest assessment of how my skills align with your requirements.

I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Best regards,

Mihkel Putrinš
