**Subject: Application for Senior Backend Developer Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Backend Developer position at EWQ Zone Oy. With over 20 years of backend development experience, specializing in Node.js (15 years, 8/10 proficiency), MongoDB, and scalable system architecture, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to EWQ's retail technology solutions across the Nordics.

Your job posting emphasizes Node.js, MongoDB, Docker, backend architecture, and customer collaboration - areas where my experience aligns strongly. The Entu data management platform I have architected and developed since 2010 serves 30+ organizations with a Node.js API backend and MongoDB database. This long-term production deployment demonstrates my ability to build and maintain scalable, reliable backend systems. At PÖFF (Black Nights Film Festival), I led a 4-member development team using Node.js-based Strapi CMS with PostgreSQL, managing the technical architecture for an international cultural event's entire digital infrastructure across multiple domains (poff.ee, justfilm.ee, kinoff.ee, industry.poff.ee, shorts.poff.ee).

My MongoDB expertise spans 15 years as the primary database for the Entu platform, complemented by PostgreSQL experience (PÖFF, 3+ years) and MySQL (Eesti Mälu Instituut, 7 years). I have designed database schemas, optimized queries, and integrated databases with backend APIs for diverse use cases - from school libraries and museums to festival logistics and historical data publication. This breadth of database experience positions me well to work with your Queue Management, Digital Signage, and Electronic Shelf Labels systems.

Docker containerization has been central to my recent work. For the Estonian Memory Institute, I designed and implemented an Elasticsearch-based real-time data publication system using Docker containers on DigitalOcean, serving 100,000+ records with 5-minute update latency for memoriaal.ee and wwii-refugees.ee. This project required isolated development, testing, and production environments - demonstrating my understanding of containerized workflows and deployment practices.

Backend architecture and infrastructure are core strengths developed through 15+ years of system design work. I have built API backends, designed RESTful services, integrated diverse systems, and made architectural decisions that balanced scalability, maintainability, and business needs. At the Estonian Academy of Arts (2009-2012), I planned and built the campus-wide LAN infrastructure connecting 700+ users across multiple buildings, managed IT infrastructure, and migrated 700 email accounts to Google Mail (reducing costs by 90%) - demonstrating my broader infrastructure understanding beyond pure software development.

Customer collaboration has been integral to my work at Entusiastid OÜ, where I have communicated directly with customers and partners for 15 years to adapt the Entu platform to specific organizational needs. At PÖFF, I partnered with stakeholders and contributed to turning festival requirements into technical solutions. My mentoring of 4 interns (100% hired full-time after completion) demonstrates my ability to communicate technical concepts effectively and guide others' professional development.

Documentation is a skill I take seriously (9/10 proficiency). I have created clear, comprehensive technical documentation for both developers and end-users, following best practices of structure, examples, explanations, and continuous updates. Public examples of my documentation work can be found in GitHub repositories, where I describe complex system workflows and API usage to enable quick understanding.

Regarding AI tools - which your job posting mentions as a bonus - I have been actively using AI development tools since April 2024. I work with GitHub Copilot for code generation and completion, MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for context-aware AI integration, and LLM APIs (Claude, GPT) for structured workflows and autonomous agents. Recent projects include the ai-team repository (autonomous development team simulation built in two weeks while honoring all best practices) and the current cv_system project (AI-powered job application generation with fact-checking agents and structured prompt engineering). This experience has taught me how to leverage AI tools to boost development efficiency while maintaining code quality and architectural integrity.

I must be transparent about areas where my experience does not fully align with your requirements. While I have strong Node.js expertise, I do not have professional PHP development experience - a skill you explicitly list as essential. I recognize PHP is a primary requirement for this role. However, my 20+ years of backend development across multiple languages (Node.js, Python, Java, .NET) demonstrates my ability to work effectively in diverse backend ecosystems. My understanding of backend fundamentals - API design, database integration, server-side logic, performance optimization - is language-agnostic. I am committed to rapidly developing PHP proficiency if given the opportunity, leveraging my extensive backend experience to accelerate the learning curve.

Additionally, while I have strong documentation skills and work well in collaborative environments, I have not used Jira or Confluence specifically. I am confident I can quickly adapt to these Agile tools given my documentation mindset and experience working in team settings. My Elasticsearch experience (from the ELK stack) provides a foundation for learning the complete monitoring stack. I do not have Finnish or Swedish language skills, though my English proficiency is C1-C2 across all areas (listening, reading, speaking, writing).

What excites me about EWQ Zone is the opportunity to work on tangible retail technology that directly shapes real-world environments across the Nordics. Queue Management Systems, Digital Signage, and Electronic Shelf Labels are visible, impactful products - exactly the kind of work where I want to see my contributions make a difference. Your emphasis on ownership, collaboration, and shaping backend technologies aligns with how I approach development work: taking responsibility for solutions from architecture to deployment, working closely with experienced colleagues, and continuously improving technical practices.

I am particularly drawn to your collaborative team culture and the opportunity to deepen backend expertise while working on high-profile retail projects. The chance to partner with customers in workshops, turn real-world needs into technical solutions, and contribute to a supportive workplace that prioritizes well-being resonates strongly with my professional values.

I am eager to bring my Node.js expertise, MongoDB experience, Docker containerization skills, backend architecture knowledge, and customer collaboration abilities to EWQ Zone. While I recognize the PHP gap, I am confident that my strong backend fundamentals, proven ability to learn new technologies, and commitment to delivering high-quality scalable solutions make me a valuable candidate worth considering.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to EWQ Zone's retail technology innovations and to address any questions about my background or the PHP learning commitment.

I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to the possibility of joining your team in Helsinki.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš
