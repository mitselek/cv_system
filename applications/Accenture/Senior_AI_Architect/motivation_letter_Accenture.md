**Subject: Application for Senior AI Architect**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior AI Architect position at Accenture. I discovered this opportunity through Duunitori and am drawn to Accenture's commitment to delivering enterprise-grade AI architectures that create measurable business value for Nordic and global clients.

I bring 15+ years of experience designing and delivering cloud-based distributed systems, with deep expertise in Node.js (8/10 proficiency) and Python (9/10 proficiency). At Entusiastid OÜ, I have architected and maintained a data management platform serving 30+ organizations since 2010, utilizing Node.js API backends, Vue.js frontends, and MongoDB databases deployed on AWS infrastructure. As Development Lead at PÖFF (Black Nights Film Festival) from 2021-2024, I led a 4-member development team and architected the technical infrastructure for an international cultural event, implementing Node.js-based solutions with Strapi CMS and PostgreSQL across multiple festival domains. At Eesti Kunstiakadeemia (2009-2012), I planned and built the entire university's local area network infrastructure spanning multiple buildings and connecting 700+ users, and successfully migrated 700 email accounts to Google Mail, reducing IT costs by 90%.

Your posting emphasizes strong software engineering skills including Git, testing strategies, documentation, CI/CD, and agile methodologies. Documentation is one of my core strengths with a proficiency rating of 9/10. I maintain active GitHub repositories at github.com/mitselek and have created extensive public documentation for complex systems. My English communication skills are strong (C1-C2 level), and I have successfully collaborated with international clients and teams throughout my career. I also have a proven track record in team leadership and mentoring - all 4 interns I supervised at PÖFF were hired full-time after completing their internships.

I must be transparent about a significant gap in my background: while I have extensive experience in software architecture, database design, API development, and cloud-based systems, I do not have documented ML/AI project experience or hands-on work with GenAI technologies such as LangChain, vector databases, RAG pipelines, or LLMOps practices that are central to this role. I recognize this represents a meaningful difference between my current expertise and the position requirements.

However, I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to apply my strong foundation in distributed systems, Python/Node.js development, and architectural thinking to the AI domain. My experience architecting systems for diverse organizations, designing APIs and data pipelines, and leading technical teams provides transferable skills that could support a transition into AI architecture. I am committed to rapid learning and would welcome the opportunity to discuss whether Accenture offers pathways for experienced architects to develop AI/ML expertise through mentorship, training programs, or gradual responsibility growth.

I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at +372 5656 0978 or mitselek@gmail.com. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Accenture's AI initiatives while developing expertise in this exciting field.

Sincerely,

Mihkel Putrinš
