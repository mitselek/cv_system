## Notes

This application represents an honest assessment of fit for a Senior AI Architect role. While the candidate brings strong software architecture, system design, and programming expertise, the lack of ML/AI experience represents a significant gap for this position.

The application emphasizes transferable skills (architecture, Python/Node.js, cloud systems, team leadership) while being transparent about the AI/ML experience gap. This position may be better suited for someone transitioning into AI architecture with strong foundation skills who is committed to rapid learning in the AI/ML domain.

Consider whether Accenture offers pathways for experienced architects to transition into AI roles through internal training or mentorship programs.
