# Hexawords

**Wordsearch puzzle game on hexagonal grid - Python game development**

An innovative take on classic word search puzzles, implementing hexagonal grid geometry for a unique gameplay experience. Demonstrates algorithmic problem-solving and game development skills in Python.

## Concept

Traditional word search games use rectangular grids. Hexawords explores hexagonal geometry, creating:

- Different movement patterns (6 directions instead of 8)
- Unique spatial relationships
- Novel puzzle generation challenges
- Fresh gameplay mechanics

## Technology

### Language & Tools

- **Python** - Primary implementation language
- **Algorithm Design** - Hexagonal grid traversal
- **Game Logic** - Word placement and validation
- **Puzzle Generation** - Automated puzzle creation

### Technical Challenges
