# Mozart Requiem

**Mozart's Requiem score visualization and publishing using CartoCSS**

A complete rendering of Mozart's Requiem Mass in D minor (K. 626) using innovative cartographic visualization technology. This project demonstrates the application of GIS styling techniques to classical music notation.

## Project Scope

### Classical Work

- **Composer:** Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
- **Work:** Requiem Mass in D minor, K. 626
- **Genre:** Classical choral music
- **Complexity:** Full orchestral and choral score

### Technical Achievement

- Complete multi-movement work
- Multiple instrumental and vocal parts
- Complex notation requirements
- Professional-quality output

## Technology

### CartoCSS Implementation

- **Language:** CartoCSS (map styling language)
- **Purpose:** Musical notation rendering
- **Output:** Vector-based score visualization
- **Innovation:** GIS technology applied to music notation

### Technical Challenges

- Multi-voice score layout
- Complex orchestral notation
- Precise symbol positioning
- Page layout and formatting
- Large-scale project organization

## Classical Music + Modern Technology
