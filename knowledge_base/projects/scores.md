# Scores

**Musical score publishing using cartographic visualization techniques**

An innovative approach to musical notation and score publishing, leveraging CartoCSS (a cartographic styling language) for precise control over musical symbol placement and rendering.

## Innovation

### Cross-Domain Technology Application

This project represents creative technical problem-solving by adapting geographic information system (GIS) technology for musical notation:

- **CartoCSS** designed for map styling → Musical score rendering
- **Spatial precision** tools → Musical symbol placement
- **Vector graphics** capabilities → Scalable notation
- **Web standards** → Digital score distribution

## Technology

### CartoCSS Platform

- **Language:** CartoCSS (Cascading Style Sheets for cartography)
- **Output:** Vector-based musical notation
- **Approach:** Declarative styling language for precise positioning
- **Format:** Web-compatible score rendering

### Technical Advantages

- Precise pixel-perfect symbol placement
- Scalable vector output (no resolution loss)
- CSS-like syntax for style control
- Web-native format for distribution
- Separation of content and presentation

## Musical Score Publishing

### Capabilities

- Professional-quality notation rendering
- Complex musical symbol placement
- Multi-voice score support
- Page layout control
- Print and digital output

### Use Cases

- Original composition publication
- Classical music scores
- Educational materials
- Web-based score distribution
- Archival documentation
